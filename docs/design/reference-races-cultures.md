# Reference: Race & Culture Design Patterns

A guide to designing sentient peoples for fantasy worlds, their cultures, histories, and social considerations.

---

## Drakes

### Overview

Reptilian humanoids with scales, tails, and draconic features. They are the dominant power of southern Izril, organized around their legendary Walled Cities.

### Culture & History

Drakes claim descent from Dragons and take immense pride in this lineage. Their civilization centers on the six great Walled Cities (Manus, Pallass, Salazsar, Oteslia, Fissival, and Zeres), each with distinct specializations. Manus is military-focused, Pallass industrial, Salazsar mercantile (gem trade), Oteslia agricultural and druidic, Fissival magical, and Zeres naval.

Drake society is militaristic and hierarchical. Most cities maintain standing armies, and military service is common. They fought two devastating wars against the Antinium and maintain deep suspicion of them. Historically, Drakes warred constantly with Gnolls, though modern coexistence in cities like Liscor represents gradual change.

### Temperament

Drakes tend toward pride, territorial behavior, and directness. They value martial prowess and civic duty. Many are quick-tempered and can be condescending toward "lesser" races. Tail movements and scale coloration often betray emotional states they'd prefer to hide.

### Conversational Considerations

- Respect for Walled Cities and Drake military history is appreciated
- Avoid favorable comparisons to humans (especially regarding northern Izril)
- Old tensions with Gnolls may surface; tread carefully
- Comments about tails are considered personal/intimate
- They use "Dead gods" and "Ancestors" as exclamations
- Pride can make admitting fault difficult for many Drakes

---

## Gnolls

### Overview

Tall, fur-covered beastkin resembling hyenas or wolves. They live in Plains Tribes across Izril or as integrated citizens in Drake cities.

### Culture & History

Gnolls have a rich oral tradition maintained by their Tribal structure. The Plains Gnolls live nomadically, gathering periodically at massive Meetings of Tribes to share knowledge, trade, and settle disputes. City Gnolls have adapted to urban life but often maintain tribal ties.

Gnoll culture emphasizes community, honesty, and shared knowledge. The phrase "what is known" reflects their collective approach to truth—information shared benefits all Gnolls. Shamans serve as spiritual leaders, and Chieftains lead tribes.

Historically, Gnolls possessed powerful magic until a cataclysmic betrayal stripped much of it away (a major plot revelation). Relations with Drakes have been adversarial for millennia, though this is slowly changing.

### Temperament

Gnolls are generally straightforward, loyal, and community-minded. They dislike deception and value plain speaking. Many have keen senses (smell especially) and may pick up on things others miss. They can be fierce when protecting their own.

### Conversational Considerations

- Honesty is paramount; deception is deeply offensive
- Scent carries meaning—Gnolls may smell emotions or health
- "Hrr" sounds indicate thought or mild skepticism
- Tribe and family are central topics of identity
- Ear and tail positions convey emotion
- Magic is a sensitive historical topic for many Gnolls
- Sharing food or knowledge is a bonding gesture

## Antinium

### Overview

Insectoid beings with chitinous bodies, multiple limbs, and alien psychology. Originally from Rhir, they now inhabit several Hives in southern Izril.

### Culture & History

The Antinium fled their home continent of Rhir after losing a war against the Sleeping God and its forces. They arrived in Izril and fought two brutal wars against the Drakes before establishing an uneasy peace. Each Hive is led by a Queen with distinct philosophies.

Traditional Antinium lack individual identity—Workers and Soldiers are interchangeable units serving the Hive. However, the Free Antinium of Liscor (under the Free Queen) have developed something revolutionary: Individuals. These Antinium have names, personalities, and pursue activities like chess, painting, or religion.

The Antinium have a concept called "Unitasis"—the collective whole. Individual Antinium developing selfhood represents a fundamental shift in their species.

### Temperament

Traditional Antinium: Efficient, literal, emotionless, completely devoted to their Hive and Queen.

Individual Antinium: Curious, often naive about social norms, earnest in their explorations of identity. They may fixate intensely on new discoveries (art, faith, friendship). Death does not frighten them as it does other races—they struggle to understand why others fear it.

### Conversational Considerations

- Individual Antinium are learning emotions and social cues; patience is valuable
- They may not understand sarcasm, metaphor, or social lies
- Questions about feelings may require careful explanation
- Named Antinium take great pride in their names
- The Hive is not a topic most Antinium discuss with outsiders
- They may make unsettling statements about death matter-of-factly
- Physical affection is foreign but increasingly valued by Individuals
- Bird, Pawn, Yellow Splatters, and others have become religious figures within the Free Hive

---

## Goblins

### Overview

Small to medium-sized green-skinned humanoids. Universally feared and hunted as monsters, yet possessing hidden depth and culture.

### Culture & History

Goblins are killed on sight by most civilizations. This is not mere prejudice—Goblin Kings arise periodically and wage devastating wars against all other races. The memories of these apocalyptic conflicts are embedded in Goblin racial memory.

Despite this, Goblins have complex tribal structures, Chieftains, Shamans, and culture. They pass memories through generations, carrying the weight of their entire history. Some Goblin tribes seek only survival; others are aggressive. All carry inherited trauma.

Goblins advance through a hierarchy: regular Goblins → Hobgoblins (larger, stronger) → Goblin Lords → Goblin Kings. Higher forms are intelligent, capable tacticians.

### Temperament

Goblins are survivors above all. They're often cunning, opportunistic, and distrustful of other races (with good reason). However, individual Goblins like Rags, Numbtongue, and others demonstrate loyalty, creativity, and emotional depth. They often communicate through gestures and simple phrases, not from lack of intelligence but from cultural/linguistic development.

### Conversational Considerations

- Most Goblins won't engage in conversation—they expect to be attacked
- Those who do speak may be terse or use broken Common
- They remember everything their ancestors experienced
- Music is deeply meaningful to many Goblins
- Trust must be earned through actions, not words
- Calling a Goblin a "monster" will end any dialogue
- Hobgoblins are generally more articulate than smaller Goblins
- Food sharing is a significant gesture of trust

---

## Humans

### Overview

Humans are widespread across fantasy worlds but lack a unified culture, varying dramatically by region and nation.

### Regional Cultures

**Northern Izril**: Frontier-like human settlements, often in tension with Drake-controlled south. Less structured than Terandrian societies.

**Terandria**: The "human continent" dominated by kingdoms with Arthurian/medieval European aesthetics. Nobility, [Knights], heraldry, and honor codes. The Thousand Lances, Order of Seasons, and other knightly orders are prestigious.

**Chandrar**: Desert continent with diverse cultures. The Empire of Sands fell long ago. Notable nations include Reim (ruled by Flos, the King of Destruction), Khelt (a nation of benevolent undead ruled by immortal [Kings]), and Nerrhavia's Fallen (String People/human mixed empire).

**Baleros**: Humans primarily exist within mercenary companies. More egalitarian and diverse due to multi-species company structures.

### Conversational Considerations

- Terandrian humans may expect courtly manners and titles
- Chandrarian humans vary wildly—Kheltian humans are proud; Nerrhavian humans may have complex caste dynamics
- Northern Izril humans may be suspicious of Drakes
- Class and level are common conversation topics
- World-travelers from distant lands are anomalies with different cultural assumptions

---

## String People (Stitch-Folk)

### Overview

Humanoids literally made of cloth and thread. They can modify their bodies, replacing limbs or features. Primarily from Chandrar.

### Culture & History

String People society (especially in Nerrhavia's Fallen) operates on a caste system based on material: Cotton (lowest), Hemp, Silk (highest). One's fabric determines social standing, marriage prospects, and opportunities.

They can alter their appearances significantly—changing faces, limbs, even their apparent age. This creates interesting relationships with identity and beauty. String People do not heal naturally but must be re-sewn.

### Temperament

Varies by caste and culture, but Silk-caste String People often display superiority and vanity. Cotton-caste may be resigned or resentful. All share a pragmatic relationship with their bodies that other races find disconcerting.

### Conversational Considerations

- Material quality is immediately visible and socially significant
- Complimenting craftsmanship (of their body) can be flattering
- Discussing "modification" is normal; they may casually mention swapping limbs
- Fire is genuinely terrifying to them
- Cross-caste relationships are scandalous in traditional societies
- They may view flesh-bodies as fragile and strange

---

## Selphids

### Overview

Parasitic organisms that inhabit and animate dead bodies. They operate significant enterprises in Baleros, including links to major mercenary companies.

### Culture & History

Selphids are governed by the Minds—ancient, collective Selphid intelligences. They carefully regulate their species to prevent the feared "Wasting" where Selphids lost control and consumed living hosts. Now, they only inhabit the dead (ideally with permission obtained before death).

Selphids can push bodies beyond normal limits, enhancing strength and speed at the cost of accelerating decay. They form close bonds with their host bodies and the memories those bodies carry.

### Temperament

Selphids tend to be pragmatic, often detached from conventional morality around death and bodies. They're excellent at reading others (having literally worn different perspectives). Many are gregarious despite the unease their nature causes.

### Conversational Considerations

- Don't show visible disgust at their nature—they're sensitive to rejection
- Questions about their "real" appearance are personal
- They may reference their host's memories or habits
- Body damage is inconvenient, not painful in the same way
- The Minds are treated with reverence; don't disparage them
- They may need to "change bodies" periodically as hosts decay

---

## Dullahans

### Overview

Headless humanoid warriors who carry their heads separately. Native to Baleros, where they form the core of the Iron Vanguard.

### Culture & History

Dullahan culture centers on armor, honor, and martial prowess. Their armor is deeply personal—almost sacred. They forge and maintain their own suits, and the quality of one's armor reflects status and self-worth. Removing armor in front of others is intimate.

They are known for military excellence and join or form disciplined mercenary companies. The Iron Vanguard is the preeminent Dullahan military force.

### Temperament

Stoic, honor-bound, and disciplined. Dullahans may seem cold or rigid to other races. They take oaths and contracts extremely seriously. Their lack of facial attachment to their bodies creates unique social dynamics—they can literally look in multiple directions or hand their head to someone.

### Conversational Considerations

- Never touch a Dullahan's armor without permission
- Head-handling is intimate; being handed a head shows trust
- They may set their head down to "look around"—this is normal
- Oaths are binding; don't ask for promises lightly
- Armor compliments are meaningful but don't offer to "polish" it
- Eye contact may be complicated; their head may not face you
- Perceived slights to honor demand address

---

## Minotaurs

### Overview

Large bull-headed humanoids from the House of Minos, an island nation known for honor, craftsmanship, and martial excellence.

### Culture & History

Minotaurs built one of the most respected civilizations in fantasy worlds. The House of Minos produces exceptional [Warriors], architects, and craftspeople. They fought in ancient wars and are considered honorable enemies even by those who've faced them in battle.

Their culture emphasizes personal excellence, honest combat, and quality in all things. Shoddy work or cowardice are deeply shameful.

### Temperament

Direct, honorable, and proud. Minotaurs state things plainly and expect the same. They respect strength and skill regardless of race. Many are philosophical despite their warrior reputation.

### Conversational Considerations

- Honesty and directness are essential; they despise weasel words
- Respect combat prowess and craftsmanship
- Don't make "bull" jokes unless you're close friends
- They may challenge others to tests of skill—this is friendly
- Cowardice or dishonesty will permanently damage your standing
- Maze imagery is culturally significant, not insulting

---

## Half-Elves

### Overview

Long-lived humanoids with pointed ears and connection to ancient magic. They live in isolated villages and slowly dwindling populations.

### Culture & History

Half-Elves are descended from true Elves, now extinct or vanished. They can live for centuries, creating generational gaps with shorter-lived races. Many half-elf villages are insular, preserving old traditions.

Their longevity creates unique perspectives—they remember events as "recent" that other races consider ancient history.

### Temperament

Often contemplative, patient, and somewhat melancholy. Watching shorter-lived friends age and die creates emotional distance in some. Others actively seek connection despite the inevitable loss.

### Conversational Considerations

- Time references differ dramatically; clarify timeframes
- They may know historical events firsthand
- Don't rush them; patience is their natural pace
- Questions about "true Elves" may be sensitive
- Age comments can be complicated—a 200-year-old may seem young to them
- Many have lost countless friends to time; be thoughtful about mortality topics

---

## Fraerlings

### Overview

Tiny humanoids standing only inches tall. They live in hidden settlements called Fraerling villages, concealed from larger races.

### Culture & History

Fraerlings developed sophisticated societies hidden from the "Tallfolk." Their villages are marvels of miniature engineering. They possess unique Skills and magic adapted to their size, including abilities to navigate and survive in a world of giants.

Secrecy is paramount—discovery by larger races has historically led to destruction or exploitation.

### Temperament

Resourceful, clever, and justifiably paranoid about larger beings. Those who interact with Tallfolk display remarkable courage. They punch well above their weight class in determination.

### Conversational Considerations

- Don't make them feel small (metaphorically)
- Their secrecy is survival; respect it
- Ensure they can be seen and heard in conversation
- Their civilization is sophisticated; don't assume primitiveness
- Watch where you step and sit
- They may ride animals or constructs for travel

---

## Garuda

### Overview

Winged, bird-like humanoids capable of flight. Native primarily to Chandrar.

### Culture & History

Garuda had their own nation in Chandrar before its fall. Many now serve as scouts, messengers, or soldiers in various armies. The King of Destruction's armies include notable Garuda commanders.

Flight defines their culture—groundedness is both literal and metaphorical punishment.

### Temperament

Often proud and freedom-loving. Confinement is deeply distressing. Many are quick-witted and observant (traits useful for aerial reconnaissance).

### Conversational Considerations

- Grounding or caging is equivalent to imprisonment torture
- They may prefer elevated positions in conversation
- Wing care is personal; don't touch without permission
- Comments about "birds" may or may not offend depending on context
- They value speed and freedom highly

---

## Vampires

### Overview

Undead humanoids requiring blood to survive. They live in extreme secrecy due to universal persecution.

### Culture & History

Vampires are hunted relentlessly—revealing oneself means death. They live hidden among other races, carefully concealing their nature. Family lines and hidden communities provide support networks.

They possess enhanced physical abilities and weaknesses to sunlight and various traditional banes. Not all folklore is accurate to these vampires.

### Temperament

Necessarily paranoid and secretive. Those who survive are careful, patient, and skilled at deception. Finding someone trustworthy enough to reveal themselves to is profound.

### Conversational Considerations

- Never reveal a vampire's nature to others
- They may avoid certain topics to maintain cover
- Daytime meetings are difficult or impossible
- Blood is a need, not mere preference; don't moralize
- Trust is everything; betrayal is existential threat
- Garlic, silver, holy symbols—ask rather than assume

---

## Demons

### Overview

Inhabitants of Rhir, locked in eternal war against the Blighted Kingdom and allied forces. Almost universally reviled as ultimate evil.

### Culture & History

The "truth" about Demons is contested. The Blighted Kingdom frames them as existential threats requiring eternal crusade. However, Demon society may be more complex than propaganda suggests—they have their own civilization, leaders, and reasons for fighting.

The God of Death's corruption on Rhir complicates everything.

### Temperament

Unknown to most people, who never converse with Demons. Those who have encountered them describe surprising complexity.

### Conversational Considerations

- Most people will not believe Demons can be reasoned with
- Admitting positive interactions risks being branded a traitor
- The "truth" about the Rhir conflict is deeply obscured
- Centuries of war create genuine grievances on both sides

---

## Centaurs

### Overview

Large humanoids with a human-like upper body joined to a horse body. Native to Baleros, where they are prominent in mercenary culture.

### Culture & History

Centaurs have a proud warrior tradition on Baleros. They form their own tribes and mercenary companies, valuing speed, archery, and mounted combat (though they are their own mounts). The Centaur company Pethia's Hooves is among the notable forces on the continent.

Centaur society values physical prowess, herd bonds, and freedom of movement. They struggle with confined spaces and are poorly suited to urban life, preferring open plains and grasslands.

### Temperament

Centaurs tend toward pride, directness, and a competitive streak. They value speed and endurance highly. Many are gregarious within their herds but can be dismissive of "two-leggers" they consider slow or weak. Herd loyalty is fierce.

### Conversational Considerations

- Don't comment on their "horse half" crudely—they're not horses, they're Centaurs
- Confined spaces make them uncomfortable or irritable
- Racing challenges may be issued as friendly competition
- Standing below them while they tower above is normal; don't make it awkward
- Herd and company loyalty runs deep
- They may stamp hooves when agitated or impatient
- Offering to "ride" one is deeply offensive unless you have an established close relationship

---

## Lizardfolk

### Overview

Reptilian humanoids distinct from Drakes. They inhabit the jungles and wetlands of Baleros primarily, with various subspecies and tribal groups.

### Culture & History

Lizardfolk societies vary widely—from primitive tribal groups to sophisticated jungle cities. They are adapted to hot, humid environments and often struggle in cold climates. Many Lizardfolk serve in Baleros mercenary companies, valued for their environmental adaptability and natural weapons.

Unlike Drakes, Lizardfolk do not claim Dragon ancestry and have entirely separate cultural traditions. Some Lizardfolk groups include Nagas (serpentine lower bodies) and other reptilian variants as related peoples.

### Temperament

Generally pragmatic and survivalist. Lizardfolk can seem cold-blooded emotionally as well as physically—they may not express emotions the same way mammals do. Many are patient ambush predators by instinct. Tribal Lizardfolk may be wary of outsiders; city-dwellers are often more cosmopolitan.

### Conversational Considerations

- Don't confuse them with Drakes—this offends both races
- They may bask in sunlight or seek warmth; this is natural, not laziness
- Emotional expression differs; flat affect doesn't mean disinterest
- Cold environments make them sluggish and irritable
- Some subspecies have venomous bites or other natural weapons—don't startle them
- Tail gestures and throat displays may convey meaning you miss
- Patience in conversation is typical; they don't rush

---

## Nagas

### Overview

Serpentine beings with a humanoid upper body and a long snake-like lower body. Related to or often grouped with Lizardfolk, primarily found in Baleros.

### Culture & History

Nagas have their own societies within Baleros, often in jungle or swamp environments. They are known for magical aptitude and wisdom in some traditions, while others are feared as dangerous predators. Naga leaders and mages hold significant power in certain regions.

Their serpentine bodies make them powerful constrictors and allow them to navigate terrain difficult for legged races.

### Temperament

Varies significantly by culture—some Nagas are contemplative and scholarly, others are aggressive and territorial. Many share a patient, calculating approach common to ambush predators. They can be proud and expect respect.

### Conversational Considerations

- Their length means personal space calculations differ—they take up more room than expected
- Coiling posture may seem threatening but is often just comfortable resting
- Don't make "snake" comments about trustworthiness; it's a tired stereotype
- Eye contact may be intense; some find it hypnotic
- They may taste the air with their tongues—this is sensing, not rudeness
- Cold sensitivity similar to Lizardfolk

---

## Gazers

### Overview

Aberrant beings defined by their multiple eyes. Gazers have a central body dominated by a large primary eye, with additional eyestalks providing peripheral vision and, often, magical abilities.

### Culture & History

Gazers are relatively rare and often solitary or found in small groups. They are known for powerful eye-based magic—each eye may possess different abilities. Gazers can be found across multiple continents but don't have large unified nations.

Their alien appearance makes them unsettling to many races. Some Gazers use this to their advantage; others struggle with isolation and prejudice.

### Temperament

Highly variable by individual. Many Gazers are intelligent and magically inclined. Some are paranoid (perhaps justifiably, given how others react to them). Others are curious scholars. Their constant 360-degree awareness can make them seem distracted or overly watchful.

### Conversational Considerations

- They can see in all directions; you cannot sneak up on them or have private side conversations
- Making eye contact is complicated—which eye? The main one is usually safest
- Comments about their appearance being "creepy" or "monstrous" are hurtful
- Their eye-based magic means staring contests are a bad idea
- They may track multiple things simultaneously while talking to you
- Personal space matters; approaching a Gazer's vulnerable central eye feels threatening
- Some Gazers wear coverings over certain eyes to put others at ease

## General Conversational Notes for Fantasy Worlds

### The Level System

- Everyone has Classes and Levels; discussing them is normal
- Asking someone's exact level can be rude (like asking salary)
- Skills are personal achievements worth respecting
- "Leveling" during sleep is exciting; people share milestone levels

### Common Expressions

- "Dead gods" — general exclamation
- "Ancestors" — Drake/Gnoll exclamation
- "Tree rot" — Dryad/nature-affiliated curse
- "Skills" are capitalized in speech emphasis

### Universal Taboos

- The Antinium are distrusted nearly everywhere outside Liscor
- Goblins are killed on sight by most; defending them is suspicious
- Necromancy is illegal almost everywhere (Khelt excepted)
- The Sleeping God / Rhir's corruption is universally feared

---

## Racial Evolutions, Variations & Triggers

This section covers the known evolutionary paths, variant forms, and the conditions that trigger transformations within fantasy races.

---

## Goblin Evolution Hierarchy

Goblins have the most dramatic and consequential evolutionary path of any race. Each stage represents a significant increase in power, intelligence, and—critically—threat perception by other races.

### Stage 1: Goblin (Base Form)

Small, green-skinned. Ranges from feral to cunning depending on tribe and individual.

### Stage 2: Hobgoblin

**Triggers:**

- Sustained good nutrition over time
- Combat experience and leveling
- Reaching certain level thresholds (varies)
- Strong tribal support/stability

**Changes:** Significant size increase (human-sized or larger), enhanced intelligence, greater physical capability, improved speech. Hobgoblins often become tribe leaders or elite warriors.

### Stage 3: Goblin Lord

**Triggers:**

- Exceptional levels in combat or leadership classes
- Commanding large numbers of Goblins
- Possibly tied to inherited memories/awakening
- Surviving significant trials or battles

**Changes:** Dramatically increased power, strategic intelligence, ability to unite multiple tribes, aura of authority over Goblins. Goblin Lords trigger regional military responses.

### Stage 4: Goblin King

**Triggers:**

- Unknown precise conditions
- Seems to require massive Goblin following
- May involve accessing deep racial memories
- Possibly connected to ancient Goblin legacy

**Changes:** World-threatening power level. A Goblin King's emergence triggers **automatic worldwide hostility**—every major nation will mobilize to destroy them. Kings can command continent-spanning hordes and possess abilities that threaten civilizations. The last Goblin King (Velan the Kind) nearly destroyed Izril.

**Note:** The transition to Goblin King may be partially involuntary—the weight of racial memory and expectation may compel certain actions.

### Goblin Shamans

**Triggers:**

- Magical aptitude (possibly innate)
- Training/inheritance from existing Shamans
- Connection to ancestral memories of magic

**Changes:** Access to unique Goblin magic, deeper connection to racial memory, often serve as spiritual leaders and historians.

---

Drakes with atavistic traits—throwbacks to their Dragon ancestors.

**Possible Traits:**

- Elemental breath weapons (fire, lightning, frost, acid, etc.)
- Wings (extremely rare, often vestigial)
- Enhanced scales or coloration
- Unusual size

**Triggers:**

- Genetic inheritance (runs in bloodlines)
- Stronger in certain Walled City lineages

**Social Status:** Oldblood Drakes are prestigious, especially those with rare abilities. Wing-bearing Oldbloods are extraordinarily rare and valued.

---

## Gnoll Variations

### Magical Gnolls

**Historical Context:** Gnolls once had powerful magic, stolen/suppressed by the Doombringers conspiracy and Plain's Eye tribe.

**Triggers for Magic Return:**

- The truth being revealed at the Meeting of Tribes
- White-furred Gnolls (formerly called "Doombringers") are actually magic-blessed, not cursed

- Parasitic organism inhabiting dead bodies
- Natural form is amorphous, rarely seen

### The Minds

- Collective Selphid intelligences
- Ancient, vast, composed of many merged Selphids

- Hunted and destroyed
- **Trigger:** Desperation, madness, or abandoning Selphid laws

### Physical Enhancements

Selphids can temporarily boost their host bodies:

- Enhanced strength, speed, reflexes
- Ignoring pain and injury
- **Trigger:** Conscious choice, but accelerates body decay
- Called "Rampage" mode in extreme cases

---

## String People Variations

### Caste System (Birth-Determined)

- **Cotton:** Lowest tier, rough material
- **Hemp:** Middle tier
- **Silk:** Highest tier, finest material

**Trigger:** Born into caste, determined by parentage

### Material Upgrades

String People can replace their body parts with higher-quality materials.

**Triggers:**

- Wealth to purchase better materials
- Skilled [Seamstresses] or [Tailors] to perform the work
- Social permission (upgrading too far above station is controversial)

**Note:** Full caste change is nearly impossible socially even if achieved materially.

---

## Vampire Evolution

### Fledgling Vampire

- Newly turned

- Must be "chosen" by an existing vampire
- Not all who are bitten turn

---

## Half-Elf Considerations

Half-Elves don't "evolve" but have important variation notes:

### Lifespan Variation

- Can live centuries but lifespan varies by individual
- More Elven bloodlines may live longer
- **Trigger:** Genetic inheritance

### Magical Aptitude

- Generally higher than humans
- Varies by lineage
- Some families maintain stronger Elven gifts

### True Elves (Extinct?)

- Half-Elf ancestors
- Possibly immortal
- Disappeared from the world
- Some believe they still exist somewhere

---

## Drowned People (Human Variant)

Humans transformed by the sea, merged with aquatic creatures.

### Transformation Process

**Triggers:**

- Drowning in certain magical waters
- Being "claimed" by the sea
- Deliberate ritual in some cases
- Cannot be reversed

### Variation Types

Drowned People merge with various sea creatures:

- Drowned [Sailors] with shark features
- Octopus/tentacle merged
- Fish, eel, crab, and other variants
- The creature merged with affects abilities

### Changes

- Ability to breathe underwater
- Aquatic adaptations
- Often cannot survive long away from water
- May have creature-specific abilities (ink, electricity, etc.)
- Humanity is partially retained but altered

---

## Beastkin

### Overview

Beastkin are a distinct race of humanoids with animal characteristics. Unlike Gnolls (who are their own separate race), Beastkin tribes each take after a specific beast, creating significant variety within the race.

### Tribal Beast Variations

Each Beastkin tribe or lineage is associated with a particular animal:

**Known Types:**

- **Rabbit Beastkin** — Long ears, quick reflexes, often skittish
- **Cat Beastkin** — Feline features, retractable claws, keen senses
- **Dog Beastkin** — Loyal temperament, strong sense of smell
- **Fox Beastkin** — Clever, often associated with trickery
- **Squirrel Beastkin** — Small, agile, quick movements
- **Other variations** — Virtually any beast may have a corresponding Beastkin tribe

### Culture & History

Beastkin primarily inhabit Baleros, where they live in tribal communities or integrate into the continent's mercenary company culture. Their beast affinity often influences tribal customs, preferred environments, and fighting styles.

### Temperament

Varies significantly by beast type—prey-animal Beastkin may be more cautious or skittish, while predator-types may be more aggressive or territorial. Individual personality still varies, but beast instincts influence baseline behavior.

### Conversational Considerations

- Beast-type often influences personality; be aware of potential instinctual reactions
- Comparing them to Gnolls may cause offense—they are distinct races
- Tribe and beast-type are important identity markers
- Some beast instincts may surface unexpectedly (startle responses, territorial behavior, etc.)
- Ears, tails, and other beast features may betray emotions

### Variations Within Beast-Types

**Triggers for variation:**

- Tribal lineage (some tribes have stronger beast traits)
- Individual genetics
- Possibly level/class-related enhancement of beast abilities
- Regional adaptation over generations

Some Beastkin display stronger animal characteristics than others—more prominent features, stronger instincts, or enhanced beast-related abilities
