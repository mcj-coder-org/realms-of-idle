# Meta-Game Integration Layer - Design Document

## Overview
This document defines how the seven core scenarios interconnect into a unified game world. Players can engage with one scenario deeply or spread across multiple, with synergies rewarding breadth while respecting focused play.

---

## World Structure

### The Realm
All scenarios exist in a shared fantasy world with:
- **Persistent Geography**: Cities, regions, and routes shared across scenarios
- **Unified Timeline**: Seasons, events, and world-state affect all scenarios
- **Shared Economy**: Currency and certain resources flow between scenarios
- **Interconnected NPCs**: Characters may appear across multiple scenarios

### Player Identity
The player is a single protagonist with multiple "hats":
- [Innkeeper] running the tavern
- [Guildmaster] managing adventurers
- [Rancher] raising monsters
- [Alchemist] brewing potions
- [Lord] building territory
- [Summoner] binding entities
- [Merchant] trading goods

Class levels in each role accumulate independently but contribute to a unified **Player Level**.

## Scenario Unlock System

### Starting Scenario
Players choose ONE starting scenario (tutorial experience):
- Each has a complete standalone loop
- ~2-4 hours to reach "unlock threshold"

### Unlock Requirements
| Scenario | Unlocked By |
|----------|------------|
| **Inn/Tavern** | Default option |
| **Adventurer Guild** | Default option |
| **Monster Farm** | Capture first monster (Guild) OR serve monster guest (Inn) |
| **Alchemy** | Brew first potion at any facility OR reach Inn Tier 2 |
| **Territory** | Reach Guild Rank 3 OR accumulate 50,000 gold (any source) |
| **Summoner** | Discover summoning circle (Guild quest) OR Territory mana node |
| **Merchant Caravan** | Complete first trade (Inn/Guild) OR Territory market building |

### Gradual Reveal
- Unlocked scenarios start as "invitations" (story hook)
- Player chooses when to activate
- Can decline to focus on current scenarios
- No penalty for delayed activation

---

## Resource Flow Architecture

### Universal Resources
These flow freely between all scenarios:

| Resource | Generated By | Used By |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Gold** | All scenarios | All scenarios |
| **Reputation (General)** | Achievements, events | Unlocks, NPC interactions |
| **World Influence** | Major accomplishments | World events, story access |

### Convertible Resources
Can be exchanged but not automatically shared:

| Resource | Conversion Examples |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Monster Materials** | Farm → Alchemy ingredients, Guild equipment, Caravan goods |
| **Potions** | Alchemy → Guild supplies, Inn drinks, Farm treatments |
| **Summons** | Summoner → Guild party members, Territory defense, Caravan guards |
| **Territory Resources** | Territory → All scenarios (if buildings present) |

### Scenario-Specific Resources
Remain within their scenario but may have external effects:
- Inn: Reputation (Inn-specific), Secrets/Rumors
- Guild: Guild Points, Adventurer Roster
- Farm: Breeding Records, Affection
- Alchemy: Research Points, Recipe Knowledge
- Territory: Population, Regional Control
- Summoner: Contracts, Trust, Planar Influence
- Caravan: Trade Reputation, Route Knowledge

## Cross-Scenario Mechanics

### Facility Placement
Scenarios can "install" into each other:

| Host | Guest Facility | Benefit |
|------|---------------|---------|
| Inn | Guild Quest Board | Adventurers stay at inn; inn gets guild traffic |
| Inn | Alchemy Counter | Sell potions to guests; alchemy gets customers |
| Territory | Inn Building | Inn in your domain; territory gets happiness |
| Territory | Guild Branch | Adventurers clear threats; guild gets territory bonuses |
| Territory | Monster Ranch | Farm in your land; territory gets materials |
| Territory | Trade Post | Caravan hub; both get efficiency |

### Shared Personnel
Some NPCs can work across scenarios:
- **Adventurers** (Guild) can guard Caravans or defend Territory
- **Summons** (Summoner) can join Guild parties or protect Territory
- **Staff** (Inn) can manage Territory buildings
- **Workers** (Territory) can operate Farm facilities

Personnel assignment is exclusive (can't be in two places) but switchable.

### Information Network
Scenarios share intelligence:
- Inn rumors reveal Caravan price opportunities
- Guild quests discover Territory expansion options
- Caravan contacts provide Alchemy ingredient sources
- Territory scouts find Summoner ritual sites
- Farm breeding records inform Guild monster knowledge

## Synergy Bonus System

### Synergy Tiers
Operating multiple scenarios grants cumulative bonuses:

| Scenarios Active | Synergy Tier | Global Bonus |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1 | Solo | None (full scenario focus) |
| 2 | Dual | +5% XP, minor cross-benefits |
| 3 | Triangle | +10% XP, medium cross-benefits |
| 4 | Network | +15% XP, major cross-benefits |
| 5 | Empire | +20% XP, significant cross-benefits |
| 6 | Dominion | +25% XP, major cross-benefits |
| 7 | Mastery | +30% XP, all cross-benefits active |

### Specific Synergy Pairs
Certain combinations have unique bonuses:

| Pair | Synergy Name | Bonus |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Inn + Guild | "Adventurer's Home" | Guild rest time halved; Inn reputation from quests |
| Farm + Alchemy | "Natural Harmony" | +25% ingredient yield from farm monsters |
| Territory + Caravan | "Trade Empire" | Routes through territory cost nothing |
| Summoner + Guild | "Bound Legion" | Summons gain XP from guild quests |
| Inn + Caravan | "Crossroads" | Caravans rest at inn; double trade rumors |
| Farm + Guild | "Monster Hunters" | Captured monsters go to farm; farm beasts join quests |
| Alchemy + Guild | "Combat Chemistry" | Potions 50% more effective on adventurers |
| Territory + Summoner | "Planar Domain" | Territory mana doubled; summons defend automatically |

### Triple Synergies
Three-way combinations for dedicated players:

| Trio | Synergy Name | Special Mechanic |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| Inn + Guild + Alchemy | "The Complete Package" | Inn auto-produces basic potions; Guild auto-equips |
| Farm + Alchemy + Caravan | "Production Chain" | Automated material → potion → delivery pipeline |
| Territory + Guild + Summoner | "Defended Realm" | Combined defense score; auto-response to all threats |
| Inn + Caravan + Territory | "Trade Hub" | Inn becomes regional market; best prices |

## Shared Event System

### World Events
Major events affect all scenarios simultaneously:

| Event | Duration | Effects |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Dragon Awakening** | 1 week | All: Danger increased; Farm: Dragon eggs available; Guild: Dragon hunts; Summoner: Draconic entities |
| **Merchant Festival** | 3 days | Caravan: Prices favorable; Inn: Guest surge; All: Gold bonuses |
| **Planar Alignment** | 1 week | Summoner: Easier rituals; Territory: Mana surge; Alchemy: Magical ingredients |
| **Monster Migration** | 5 days | Farm: Capture opportunities; Guild: Subjugation quests; Territory: Defense events |
| **Royal Decree** | Varies | Territory: Political events; Inn: Noble guests; Guild: Official contracts |

### Cross-Scenario Quests
Missions that span multiple scenarios:

**Example: "The Plague Response"**
1. Guild: Investigate plague source (dungeon quest)
2. Alchemy: Develop cure (recipe discovery)
3. Farm: Cultivate cure ingredients (special breeding)
4. Caravan: Distribute cure to affected cities (timed delivery)
5. Inn: Treat refugees (special guests)
6. Territory: Quarantine management (policy choices)
7. Summoner: Bind healing spirits (contract negotiation)

Reward scales with how many scenarios participate.

## Shared NPC System

### Recurring Characters
NPCs appear across scenarios in different roles:

| NPC | Inn Role | Guild Role | Other Appearances |
|-----|----------|------------|-------------------|
| **Marcus the Bold** | Regular patron | Veteran adventurer | Caravan guard, Territory advisor |
| **Sera Nightwhisper** | Mysterious guest | Quest giver | Summoner contact, Alchemy customer |
| **Old Tom** | Kitchen helper | Retired adventurer | Farm hand, Territory settler |
| **Lady Vex** | Noble guest | Guild sponsor | Caravan investor, Territory rival |

### Relationship System
- NPCs remember interactions across scenarios
- Favor built in one scenario affects others
- Some NPCs have cross-scenario questlines
- Reputation with factions spans all scenarios

## Economy Balancing

### Gold Sinks by Scenario
Each scenario has primary gold drains:

| Scenario | Primary Sink | Secondary Sink |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Inn | Upgrades, supplies | Staff wages |
| Guild | Equipment, recruitment | Facility upgrades |
| Farm | Feed, habitats | Breeding, treatment |
| Alchemy | Ingredients, equipment | Research |
| Territory | Construction, wages | Military, expansion |
| Summoner | Offerings, rituals | Contract payments |
| Caravan | Goods, caravans | Guards, tolls |

### Inflation Control
- Cross-scenario gold costs scale with total earning capacity
- Luxury purchases (cosmetics, prestige items) absorb excess
- Prestige resets remove currency while preserving progress
- Investment systems lock gold for timed returns

### Trade Balance
- Scenarios producing goods must have demand elsewhere
- No scenario should be "gold printing" without gameplay
- Synergy bonuses favor efficiency, not raw generation
