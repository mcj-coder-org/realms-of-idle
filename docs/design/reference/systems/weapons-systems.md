# Weapons Systems

## Weapon Philosophy

Weapons in the game represent more than mechanical stats—they embody distinct fighting philosophies, cultural significance, and character identity. Each weapon category offers unique approaches to combat, enabling players to build distinctive fighting styles.

### Versatility vs Specialization

Different weapons create different gameplay experiences:

- **Versatile weapons** (shortsword, longsword) enable adaptability across situations
- **Specialized weapons** (rapier, greatsword) excel in specific roles but require commitment
- **Off-hand weapons** (daggers, short spears) enable hybrid strategies
- **Two-handed weapons** (greatsword, polearms) maximize raw power

## Weapon Categories

### Swords

Swords are the most versatile weapon category, offering options for every fighting style, body type, and tactical situation. From the nimble rapier to the devastating greatsword, sword mastery opens paths to both martial excellence and social prestige.

#### Sword Types Overview

| Sword      | Tier       | Hands | Damage | Speed     | Style     | Cost (Steel) |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----- | ------ | --------- | --------- | ------------ |
| Shortsword | Apprentice | 1     | 8-12   | Fast      | Versatile | 50 copper    |
| Longsword  | Journeyman | 1-2   | 12-18  | Medium    | Balanced  | 150 copper   |
| Rapier     | Journeyman | 1     | 8-14   | Very Fast | Finesse   | 200 copper   |
| Greatsword | Master     | 2     | 20-30  | Slow      | Power     | 500 copper   |

#### Choosing Your Sword

**For Beginners**: [Shortsword](../../content/items/weapons/swords/shortsword.md) - Learn fundamental techniques without overwhelming complexity. Light enough to practice for hours, versatile enough to remain useful as you advance.

**For Versatility**: [Longsword](../../content/items/weapons/swords/longsword.md) - The professional's choice. Use with shield for defense, two-hand for power, or one-handed for flexibility. Unlocks advanced techniques.

**For Finesse**: [Rapier](../../content/items/weapons/swords/rapier.md) - Speed and precision over raw power. Ideal for dexterous fighters, urban environments, and formal dueling. Socially acceptable in most contexts.

**For Power**: [Greatsword](../../content/items/weapons/swords/greatsword.md) - Maximum damage and reach at the cost of speed and flexibility. Excels against multiple enemies and breaking formations. Requires significant strength and training.
