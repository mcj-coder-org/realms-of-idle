A multi-scenario idle RPG where players build interconnected fantasy enterprises—from cozy inns to sprawling empires—in a world where Classes, Levels, and the System govern all. Inspired by LitRPG and progression fantasy, *Realms of Idle* rewards both deep focus and broad management across seven unique playstyles.
