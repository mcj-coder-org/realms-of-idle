# Housekeeper

## Lore

### Origin

The Housekeeper transforms spaces from used to welcoming - the crisp sheets, the spotless floors, the subtle scent of lavender. Where innkeepers can prepare basic rooms adequately, housekeepers elevate cleanliness to an art. They know which linens last longest, how to remove any stain, and can prepare a room in half the time while achieving twice the quality.

Housekeeping is invisible excellence. When done properly, guests don't notice the work - they simply feel comfortable. They notice the perfectly made bed that looks inviting after a long day. The spotless washbasin. The fresh towels folded just so. The absence of dust, odors, or disorder. This invisibility is the mark of mastery: everything perfect, nothing intrusive.

The Housekeepers' Guild teaches efficiency through rigorous training. Perfect bed-making (hospital corners, wrinkle-free sheets). Stain removal (wine, blood, ink, mud). Organization systems (supply carts, cleaning routes, timing). These techniques enable housekeepers to maintain dozens of rooms to exacting standards.

### In the World

Every inn, manor, and boarding house needs housekeepers. The quality of lodging depends more on housekeeping than fancy furnishings. Travelers forgive plain furniture if rooms are spotless. They remember comfort long after forgetting décor.

Regular guests notice the housekeeper's touch - the way towels are folded, the fresh flowers by the bedside, the perfect firmness of pillows. A skilled housekeeper doesn't just clean; they create sanctuaries. They anticipate needs: extra blankets on cold nights, lighter linens in summer, blackout curtains for those who sleep late.

Housekeepers develop systems. The morning route: strip beds, collect laundry, restock supplies. The midday clean: floors, surfaces, windows. The evening preparation: turn down beds, light candles, ensure everything ready for arrivals. Efficiency comes from repetition and optimization - every movement purposeful, every tool within reach.

Master housekeepers run entire estates. They manage junior housekeepers, coordinate with laundry services, maintain supply inventories, and ensure every room meets standards. Their reputation determines inn prestige: "The Rusty Tankard's rooms are always spotless. You could eat off the floors."
