# Knight

## Lore

### Origin

Knighthood represents more than martial skill - it embodies ideals of honor, duty, and service. While Warriors fight for pay or necessity, Knights serve codes that demand sacrifice beyond self-interest. The institution emerged when rulers needed reliable military elites, binding capable fighters with oaths of loyalty and standards of conduct. Knights became civilization's champions - protectors of the weak, enforcers of law, examples of virtue.

The path to Knighthood varies by culture. Some kingdoms require noble birth, restricting the honor to aristocratic families. Others promote exceptional Warriors from common ranks. Many systems use squirehood - years serving an established Knight, learning combat, codes, and responsibilities before earning title through deeds. Regardless of path, Knights distinguish themselves from mere Warriors through their commitment to principles beyond personal gain.

Knightly codes differ across nations but share core concepts: protect the innocent, show mercy to defeated foes, fight honorably, serve loyally, maintain personal integrity. These ideals sound simple until tested in reality. When surrendering enemies beg for mercy but might return as threats. When loyalty conflicts with morality. When honor demands actions that seem foolish or suicidal. True Knights navigate these dilemmas through both conviction and practical wisdom.

### In the World

Knights occupy elevated social positions, respected for both combat prowess and moral authority. They command troops in battle, adjudicate disputes, represent their lieges in negotiations, and serve as visible symbols of order. A Knight riding through village streets inspires both pride and relief - their presence means protection and justice.

Yet knightly service demands much. Knights maintain expensive equipment - quality armor, weapons, warhorses. They provide military service when called, potentially dying for their liege's causes. They uphold honor codes that restrict behavior in ways common Warriors ignore. Many Knights struggle financially, maintaining noble appearances on limited income. Those from common backgrounds face prejudice from noble-born peers.

Mounted combat defines traditional Knight warfare. Charging on horseback with lance, breaking enemy formations through coordinated shock tactics. Knights train from youth to fight mounted, developing skills most Warriors never master. Modern warfare increasingly values infantry and range, diminishing cavalry's dominance, yet the mounted Knight remains powerful symbol and practical threat in open terrain.

Apprentice Knights (squires) serve established Knights for years. They care for armor and weapons, tend horses, and learn through observation. Training covers swordplay, horsemanship, lance techniques, strategic thinking, and conduct codes. Squires also study - many Knights learn reading, history, law, and etiquette. The goal is producing not just capable fighters but leaders and administrators.

Knighthood's romance attracts many aspirants; its reality breaks most. The duties weigh heavy. The costs accumulate. The compromises between ideals and practicality erode conviction. Yet those who persist become more than Warriors - they become living embodiments of civilization's highest aspirations, proof that humans can rise above base nature through dedication to principles.
