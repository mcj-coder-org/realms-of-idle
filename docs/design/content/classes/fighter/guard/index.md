# Guard

## Lore

### Origin

While Warriors seek combat and Knights pursue glory, Guards master the art of prevention. The Guard's duty is simple yet profound: protect people, places, and things from harm. This requires different skills than battlefield combat - awareness to spot threats before they materialize, patience to maintain vigilance through boring hours, judgment to distinguish real dangers from false alarms, and restraint to use appropriate force rather than excessive violence.

Guards have existed as long as humans owned things worth protecting. Village watchmen patrolling at night. Castle sentries standing post. Caravan escorts deterring bandits. Noble bodyguards preventing assassinations. Ship crews maintaining order at sea. Each Guard specialty requires adaptations, but all share core principles: stay alert, prevent problems, respond appropriately when prevention fails.

The Guards' Guild promotes professionalism in what could become mere thuggery. Bad Guards abuse authority, harass innocent people, accept bribes, ignore actual threats. Good Guards understand they serve the protected, not their own interests. They de-escalate situations when possible, using force only when necessary. They maintain vigilance even when exhausted. They report what they observe without bias. These standards separate professional Guards from armed bullies.

### In the World

Every settlement employs Guards proportional to its wealth and threats. Villages might maintain volunteer watches - locals taking turns patrolling. Towns hire professional Guards for gates and patrols. Cities field substantial guard forces with specialized units - traffic control, criminal investigation, riot response, dignitary protection. Without Guards, property crime explodes and violence escalates.

Guard work involves more boredom than excitement. Hours standing post watching nothing happen. Routine patrols checking the same locations repeatedly. Breaking up drunken fights. Responding to false alarms. Occasionally actual danger intrudes - thieves attempting burglary, fires breaking out, monsters entering settlements, hostile forces attacking. Guards must transition instantly from routine to crisis.

Different Guard specializations suit different personalities. Gate Guards check travelers and cargo, requiring social skills and patience. Patrol Guards walk routes regularly, needing endurance and observational skills. Bodyguards protect specific individuals, demanding constant alertness and quick reflexes. Prison Guards manage dangerous criminals, requiring both authority and restraint. Each specialty attracts different types to the profession.

Apprentice Guards learn through supervised duty. Senior Guards teach practical skills - how to spot concealed weapons, read body language indicating hostile intent, remember faces and details, maintain alertness through long shifts. New Guards make mistakes - letting through smuggled goods, missing obvious threats, overreacting to harmless situations. Experience teaches judgment that separates adequate Guards from excellent ones.

Career Guards develop cynicism from witnessing humanity's worst behavior daily. They see theft, violence, deception, cruelty. The job attracts some who enjoy power over others. Yet many Guards genuinely believe in protecting communities, finding satisfaction in preventing crimes and helping people feel safe. The best Guards balance healthy skepticism with fundamental decency.
