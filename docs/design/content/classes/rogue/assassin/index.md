# Assassin

> **Dark Path Class**: This class involves morally questionable actions. Discovery carries severe social consequences. Underground reputation operates separately from public standing.

## Lore

### Origin

Death is easy. Quick deaths look natural. Undetected deaths leave no witnesses. The Assassin's craft transforms killing from crude violence into precise art. While Warriors fight openly and Guards protect publicly, Assassins work in shadows, eliminating specific targets for money, politics, or revenge. Society condemns them publicly while employing them privately - every noble who denounces assassination has considered hiring one.

The profession emerged when conflicts couldn't be resolved through open warfare. Killing one person prevents battles killing thousands. Eliminating a corrupt leader spares innocents from their cruelty. Removing a witness silences dangerous testimony. These rationalizations let Assassins sleep at night, though many struggle with moral weight regardless. Some view themselves as necessary evils, others as neutral tools, a few as righteous executioners. All understand society will never accept them openly.

Assassination requires different skills than combat. Assassins study anatomy to identify vital spots and ensure quick deaths. They master poisons to kill without violence. They learn social skills to approach targets unsuspected. They practice stealth to enter secured locations and escape undetected. They develop patience to wait for perfect opportunities. The best Assassins make deaths look accidental - targets found dead from apparent natural causes, leaving no evidence of foul play.

### In the World

Assassins operate through underground networks, never advertising publicly. Clients contact them through intermediaries who maintain plausible deniability. Successful Assassins build reputations in shadow communities - known by aliases, judged by results, paid in untraceable methods. Failed Assassins end up executed, imprisoned, or dead from target countermeasures. The profession tolerates no incompetence.

Most Assassins maintain legitimate public identities. They work respectable jobs, live normal lives, integrate into communities. This cover provides both income and access - the friendly tavern server who overhears conversations, the trusted servant who enters noble homes, the traveling merchant who maps guard routines. Double lives strain psychologically, requiring constant vigilance about what persona knows what information.

Assassination contracts vary wildly. Political killings target leaders, creating power vacuums or preventing wars. Personal vengeance contracts eliminate those who wronged wealthy clients. Criminal contracts remove rivals, witnesses, or problematic associates. Each type carries different risks - political targets have heavy security, personal targets might have powerful allies seeking revenge, criminal targets often have dangerous organizations backing them.

Apprentice Assassins typically start as informants or lookouts for established killers, learning through observation. They practice on low-value targets - petty criminals, isolated travelers, those whose deaths attract minimal investigation. They develop signature methods - some favor poisons, others prefer blades, a few specialize in accidents. Survival depends on leaving no connections between killer and victim.

The moral weight accumulates. Each kill becomes easier mechanically but harder emotionally for those with conscience. Some Assassins develop elaborate justifications - only killing evil people, only accepting morally justified contracts, donating assassination earnings to charity. Others embrace sociopathy, viewing targets as objects rather than people. Most fall somewhere between, carrying guilt while continuing because they know nothing else profitable.
