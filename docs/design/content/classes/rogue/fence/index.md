# Fence

> **Dark Path Class**: This class involves illegal commerce with severe consequences if caught. Discovery damages reputation, triggers legal penalties, and may implicate clients. Underground reputation operates separately from public standing.

## Lore

### Origin

Stolen goods need buyers. Thieves can't use most stolen items directly - a stolen necklace is recognizable, stolen bulk goods require storage and distribution, stolen art needs wealthy collectors. Fences solve this problem, buying stolen property at fraction of value and reselling through channels obscuring provenance. Without Fences, most theft becomes impractical. They're the economic foundation of criminal enterprise.

The Fence class emerged when theft became systematic rather than opportunistic. Early Fences were legitimate Merchants willing to ask few questions about suspiciously cheap goods. As authorities cracked down on obvious fencing, the profession specialized - developing techniques to disguise stolen property, establishing underground distribution networks, cultivating corrupt officials who ignore illegal commerce. Modern Fences operate sophisticated operations rivaling legitimate businesses in complexity.

Fencing requires different skills than normal trade. Fences must evaluate stolen goods quickly, offering prices that ensure profit while keeping thieves satisfied. They must disguise items - melting down jewelry, repainting stolen art, mixing stolen goods with legitimate inventory. They must manage risk - determining which goods are too hot to handle, which officials need bribing, when to refuse dangerous transactions. They must maintain dual reputations - legitimate cover businesses while underground networks know their true trade.

### In the World

Every city with significant crime has Fences. They operate through fronts - pawn shops, second-hand dealers, antique stores, scrap yards - businesses where unusual inventory attracts minimal suspicion. Some maintain purely underground operations, accessible only through criminal connections. The most successful Fences appear completely legitimate, their illegal operations hidden behind genuine business activities.

Fences specialize based on goods and criminal connections. Some handle common stolen property - household items, tools, minor valuables. Others focus on high-value goods - jewelry, art, magical items - requiring wealthy buyers willing to purchase questionable provenance items. Some fence specific categories exclusively - weapons, books, magical components. Each specialty requires different networks and expertise.

The profession involves constant legal danger. Authorities target Fences aggressively - removing Fences disrupts entire criminal ecosystems. Possession of stolen goods brings harsh penalties. Informants can destroy Fences through testimony. Raids seize inventory and expose operations. Successful Fences survive through careful compartmentalization, multiple fronts, corrupted officials, and knowing when to sacrifice minor operations to protect major ones.

Apprentice Fences typically work as assistants in front businesses, gradually learning underground operations. They practice evaluating goods quickly, recognizing what's stolen versus legitimate, pricing items profitably, and managing dangerous clients. They discover that successful fencing depends more on network management and risk assessment than commercial skill.

Established Fences become crucial nodes in criminal networks. Thieves depend on them for income. Other criminals trade through them. Corrupt officials protect them for bribes. They accumulate power through knowing who steals what and who buys questionable goods - information valuable for blackmail or leverage. The most powerful Fences essentially run criminal enterprises, with theft operations feeding their distribution networks.
