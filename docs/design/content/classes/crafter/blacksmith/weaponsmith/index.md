# Weaponsmith

## Lore

### Origin

Where blacksmiths work with metal generally, Weaponsmiths dedicate their lives to a single pursuit: creating weapons of exceptional quality. They study blade geometry, balance points, edge retention, and the subtle interplay between form and function that transforms good weapons into legendary ones. Every masterwork sword bears the mark of a Weaponsmith who understood that weapons are not merely tools but extensions of the warriors who wield them.

The path to Weaponsmith requires years of focused study beyond standard blacksmithing. Aspiring Weaponsmiths forge thousands of blades, each teaching new lessons about steel behavior, heat treatment, and shaping techniques. They study with established masters, learning secret techniques passed down through generations. They examine historical weapons, understanding why certain designs endured while others failed. Eventually, they develop their own styles, signature approaches that make their weapons recognizable to knowledgeable buyers.

Weaponsmiths occupy elevated positions in crafting hierarchies. Their creations command premium prices. Warriors seeking the best weapons seek out renowned Weaponsmiths, sometimes waiting years for commissioned pieces. Military leaders cultivate relationships with master Weaponsmiths, knowing that superior weapons provide decisive advantages in conflict.

### In the World

Every major city hosts at least one Weaponsmith, often working from prestigious workshops near noble districts or military quarters. Their forges run hotter, their tools more specialized, their materials more carefully selected than common blacksmiths. Apprentices compete fiercely for positions, knowing that training under a master Weaponsmith opens doors throughout life.

The profession demands obsessive attention to detail. Weaponsmiths test every blade they create, checking balance, edge quality, flexibility, and durability. They reject pieces that meet ordinary standards but fall short of their personal requirements. This perfectionism means fewer pieces completed, but each one carries the smith's reputation.
