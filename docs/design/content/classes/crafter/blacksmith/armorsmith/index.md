# Armorsmith

## Lore

### Origin

Armor determines who survives battle and who doesn't. A perfectly fitted suit of plate turns lethal strikes into bruising impacts. Poorly made armor encumbers its wearer, restricts movement, and fails at critical moments. Armorsmiths dedicate their careers to the art of protection, creating defensive equipment that becomes second skin to those who wear it.

The discipline requires understanding bodies as well as metal. Armorsmiths study anatomy, learning how joints move, where strikes land, which areas need most protection. They develop fitting skills, adjusting pieces to individual wearers until armor moves naturally. They balance protection against mobility, understanding that immobile fighters become easy targets regardless of how thick their armor.

Master Armorsmiths become essential to military forces. Knights seek them for custom tournament armor. Nobles commission ceremonial suits displaying wealth and status. Guards need practical protection for daily wear. Each application demands different approaches, and Armorsmiths must master them all to serve diverse clientele.

### In the World

Armorsmiths typically establish workshops near military training grounds or noble quarters where clients concentrate. Their work requires more space than weapon forging - full suits need room for assembly and fitting sessions. Successful Armorsmiths employ assistants for basic work while focusing personally on critical fitting and finishing.

The profession attracts those with patience for repetitive perfection. A single suit of plate armor contains dozens of individual pieces, each requiring shaping, fitting, articulation, and finishing. Rush jobs produce armor that fails its wearer when needed most. Armorsmiths who prioritize speed over quality find their reputations destroyed after a few battlefield failures.
