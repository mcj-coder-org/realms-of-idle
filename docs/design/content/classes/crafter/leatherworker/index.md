# Leatherworker

## Lore

### Origin

Where metal meets flesh, the leatherworker finds their art. Leather has protected humanity since the first hunter realized that animal hide could shield skin better than cloth alone. Unlike the blacksmith's forge-fire or the tailor's delicate thread, leatherworking demands a different kind of strength - the patience to properly tan a hide, the eye to judge thickness and flexibility, the hands to work stubborn material into precise shapes.

The craft evolved from simple necessity into sophisticated artistry. Northern tribes perfected techniques for working thick furs against bitter cold. Desert peoples learned to create thin, breathable leather that protected without trapping heat. Coastal communities developed treatments that made leather resist salt water. Each region's leatherworkers adapted their craft to local needs, creating traditions as varied as the animals that provided their materials.

Dwarven leatherworkers favor thick, durable pieces that last generations. Elven crafters produce supple leather so soft it moves like silk. Halfling leatherworkers specialize in small, intricate goods - delicate pouches, fine bookbindings, comfortable slippers. The Leatherworkers' Guild recognizes all these traditions while maintaining standards: properly tanned leather should never rot, well-made seams should never split, and quality work should improve with age rather than deteriorate.

### In the World

Walk through any market and the smell of leather finds you - earthy, slightly sweet, unmistakable. The leatherworker's stall displays belts, bags, boots, bracers, and a hundred other necessities. A farmer needs a new harness for the plow ox. An adventurer requires armor that won't slow them down. A merchant wants a fine leather-bound ledger. A child treasures their first real belt, marking the transition from childhood to useful work.

Good leatherworkers know their materials intimately. They can tell cowhide from deerhide by touch, assess the quality of a tanning job at a glance, and predict how a hide will behave under stress. They maintain relationships with hunters and ranchers, ensuring a steady supply of quality materials. The best pieces come from animals that lived well and died cleanly - stress and injury show in the leather.

Apprentices spend months learning to properly prepare hides before they're allowed to craft anything. They scrape away hair and flesh, soak skins in tanning solutions that turn raw hide into durable leather, stretch and work the material until it reaches perfect suppleness. Only then do they learn to cut patterns, punch holes, saddle-stitch seams, and emboss decorative patterns. Master leatherworkers can look at a customer, assess their build and needs, and create custom-fitted pieces that feel like second skin.

The workshop smells of neat's-foot oil, saddle soap, and curing leather. Tools hang in careful order - curved needles, edge bevelers, mallets, awls, hole punches in graduated sizes. Hides stack in order of type and quality. Finished pieces await collection, each bearing the maker's mark. A good leatherworker's reputation spreads by word of mouth: "See that saddle? Ten years of hard use and the stitching's still perfect. That's Oldbrook's work."
