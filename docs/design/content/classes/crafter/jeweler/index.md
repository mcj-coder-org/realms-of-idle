# Jeweler

## Lore

### Origin

Where the blacksmith works with strength and the tailor with patience, the jeweler works with precision measured in fractions of millimeters. A jeweler's bench holds the smallest, most valuable items crafted by mortal hands - rings that mark eternal bonds, amulets that carry protective enchantments, crowns that symbolize authority. Each piece represents not just material value but meaning: love, status, faith, remembrance, power.

The jeweler's craft combines metalworking, gem-cutting, and artistic vision. They must understand metals as thoroughly as any blacksmith but work them at a scale where a heavy hand ruins months of effort. They must judge gemstones not just for beauty but for magical resonance, internal structure, and proper orientation of crystal axes. A flawed diamond might shatter during cutting. An opal set in the wrong metal loses its fire. An enchanted ring requires precise proportions to channel magical energy without overheating.

Ancient jewelers worked for temples and royalty exclusively, their secrets closely guarded. The modern Jewelers' Guild maintains high standards while allowing members to serve broader clienteles. Even a simple wedding band requires skills that take years to master. Complex pieces - crown jewels, enchanter's focuses, masterwork necklaces - represent the pinnacle of combined arts: metallurgy, gem-craft, design, and often magical theory.

### In the World

Every major town supports at least one jeweler, though their work varies with location and clientele. In mining regions, jewelers focus on processing local gemstones and creating sturdy pieces for practical wear. In cities, they craft increasingly elaborate designs for nobles and wealthy merchants. Near mage towers, jewelers specialize in enchantment focuses - rings, amulets, and circlets designed to channel specific magical energies.

Common folk visit jewelers for life's major moments. Betrothal rings mark commitments. Coming-of-age gifts celebrate transitions to adulthood. Memorial lockets preserve remembrances. Religious symbols demonstrate faith. Even simple pieces carry emotional weight far beyond their material value. A jeweler who understands this crafts not just objects but treasured heirlooms.

The wealthy commission statement pieces: elaborate necklaces, gem-studded belts, rings sized to display maximum brilliance. Such works require months or years, with multiple consultations to refine designs. The jeweler sources materials from across the realm - gold from mountain mines, pearls from coastal divers, exotic gems from traders who traveled dangerous routes. Each element must be perfect, because even minor flaws become obvious in fine jewelry.

Apprentice jewelers spend years learning before touching precious materials. They practice on copper and glass, mastering techniques with forgiving materials. Filing metal smooth without scratching adjacent areas. Cutting stone without shattering it. Setting gems so they're secure yet appear to float. Engraving designs so fine they require magnification to appreciate fully. Only after demonstrating consistent precision do they progress to gold and gems.

The workshop smells of metal polish and jeweler's rouge. Light floods the space - jewelers need perfect illumination to judge color and detect flaws. Magnifying lenses and precision tools line the benches. Tiny drawers hold sorted gemstones, organized by type and quality. Finished pieces rest in velvet-lined cases, each representing hundreds of hours of painstaking work. A master jeweler's reputation attracts clients from distant lands: "If you want quality enchantment work, see the Crown and Star in Millbrook. Their focus rings never fail."
