# Cook

## Lore

### Origin

Food is the first magic - the transformation of raw ingredients into sustenance, comfort, and joy. Every culture celebrates its cooks, from humble village hearth-tenders to the grand chefs of royal kitchens. The cook's craft combines chemistry and artistry, precision and intuition, tradition and innovation. A good meal can turn strangers into friends, soothe grief, mark celebrations, and make a simple day memorable.

The difference between someone who prepares food and a true Cook lies not in complexity but in understanding. A Cook knows that bread becomes more than flour, water, and yeast through proper technique and timing. They understand that a stew improves with patience, that certain herbs must be added at precise moments, that the same ingredients handled differently create entirely different dishes. This knowledge accumulates across generations, with each Cook adding their innovations to inherited wisdom.

The Cooks' Guild recognizes specializations - bakers, pastry makers, butchers, sauce masters - but maintains that every Cook must master fundamental techniques. You cannot create a perfect roast without understanding heat. You cannot bake proper bread without feeling dough's readiness in your hands. You cannot balance flavors without training your palate to discern subtle differences. Mastery comes through repetition, experimentation, and hundreds of meals prepared with attention.

### In the World

Food brings people together. The tavern where strangers share tables. The festival where vendors compete to sell the finest treats. The family kitchen where children learn recipes alongside reading and arithmetic. The military camp where the cook's skill affects morale as surely as a commander's leadership. The temple kitchen where volunteers prepare meals for those in need. In all these places, Cooks ply their essential craft.

A village Cook knows everyone's preferences and dietary needs. They track the seasons, planning menus around available ingredients. In spring, fresh greens and herbs. Summer's abundance allows experimentation. Autumn demands preservation - pickling, smoking, drying. Winter requires creativity with stored provisions. Good Cooks waste nothing, transforming scraps into stock, yesterday's bread into today's pudding, tough cuts into tender stews through proper technique.

City Cooks often specialize. Some run bakeries, rising before dawn to provide fresh bread. Others operate street stalls, offering quick meals to workers and travelers. Fine dining establishments employ multiple cooks, each responsible for specific stations - sauces, meats, vegetables, desserts. The head chef coordinates these specialists like a conductor leading musicians, ensuring every dish meets standards and arrives simultaneously.

Apprentice Cooks learn through endless repetition. Dice a thousand onions to develop knife skills. Crack countless eggs to master separation. Stir pots until you can judge thickness by resistance alone. Monitor roasting meats until you recognize doneness by sight and smell. Taste everything, training your palate to detect when a dish needs more salt, acid, sweetness, or heat. Only after mastering basics do apprentices earn the right to create their own recipes.

The kitchen is organized chaos - controlled, purposeful movement. Ingredients arranged within arm's reach. Knives kept razor-sharp. Pots and pans seasoned and ready. Heat managed carefully, nothing too hot or too cool. The Cook moves through prep, cooking, and plating with efficient grace, producing plate after plate of consistent quality. Their reputation spreads through satisfied customers: "Have you tried the mushroom pie at the Copper Kettle? The crust alone is worth the price."
