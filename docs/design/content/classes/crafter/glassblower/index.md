# Glassblower

## Lore

### Origin

Glass begins as sand and ash, worthless by themselves. Add fire - tremendous, sustained heat - and they become something magical: a material that flows like honey, can be shaped by breath alone, and hardens into transparent solid. The first glassmakers discovered this transformation by accident, perhaps in ancient campfires where sand and seaweed ash combined. They spent centuries learning to control it.

The great glass traditions developed where the right sand existed. Coastal regions with fine silica sand became glassmaking centers. The secrets passed through families, guarded jealously - a master glassblower's formulas for color and clarity were worth fortunes. Some families have blown glass for twenty generations, their techniques refined beyond what any single lifetime could achieve.

Modern glassblowing serves multiple masters. Alchemists need precise vessels - beakers, flasks, distillation apparatus. Enchanters require containers that can hold magical substances. Jewelers want decorative glass for settings. And ordinary households need windows, bottles, and drinking vessels. A skilled glassblower might create a delicate perfume bottle in the morning and sturdy laboratory equipment in the afternoon.

### In the World

The glassblower's workshop is the hottest place in town. The furnace runs day and night, never allowed to cool - restarting it takes days and wastes enormous fuel. Workers move in careful choreography, gathering molten glass on hollow rods, blowing and shaping before it cools, passing pieces between stations for different operations. Summer in a glass shop is nearly unbearable; winter, it's the warmest place to be.

Apprentices start by tending the furnace and preparing materials. They grind sand, measure ash, add colorants in precise quantities. Only after months of preparation work do they touch a blowpipe. Their first attempts emerge lumpy and uneven, but gradually they learn the timing - how fast glass cools, how much breath to use, when to reheat and when to shape. The material teaches patience; rush it, and it cracks.

Master glassblowers create impossible things. Vessels so thin they seem made of frozen air. Colors that shift with the light. Laboratory apparatus with precisely measured capacities. And for the rare magical commission - containers that can hold volatile essences, lenses that focus magical energy, windows that filter harmful emanations. Such work commands premium prices and enhances the glassblower's reputation across regions.
