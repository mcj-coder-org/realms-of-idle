# Tailor

## Lore

### Origin

The needle is mightier than the sword, or so tailors like to joke when warriors complain about commission prices. But there's truth beneath the humor - civilized life requires clothing, and the skill to create it well separates humans from beasts. The first tailors transformed rough hides and plant fibers into coverings that protected against weather and modesty alike. Modern tailors work miracles with needle, thread, and countless varieties of cloth.

Tailoring traditions vary wildly across cultures. In the northern kingdoms, thick wool and fur dominate, with embroidery used to show clan affiliation. Southern coastal regions favor light linen decorated with shells and glass beads. The elves weave spider silk into garments so fine they seem made of moonlight. Dwarven tailors focus on durability, creating work clothes that last generations. Each tradition insists its way is best, while customers simply want clothes that fit, look good, and don't fall apart.

The Tailors' Guild recognizes three main branches: garment makers who craft everyday clothing, armorers who create cloth and padded protection, and magical tailors who weave enchantments into fabric itself. An apprentice typically specializes in one branch, though master tailors often command all three.

### In the World

Every person wears the tailor's work from the moment they dress until they sleep. Unlike weapons that hang unused on walls or potions saved for emergencies, clothing serves constantly. A well-made shirt weathers years of wear, while a poorly sewn seam splits when you bend to lift something heavy. People remember good tailors and avoid bad ones.

Village tailors know every body in town - who's grown taller, who's gained weight after winter, who needs letting out after a baby. They attend every wedding, funeral, and festival, because those events require special clothes. The tailor's shop serves as an informal gathering place where news spreads alongside measurements and fabric choices. "Heard it at the tailor's" means gossip so fresh it might not be true yet.

Young apprentices start with straight seams on scrap cloth, sewing and unpicking until their stitches satisfy the master. They learn to cut fabric following grain, understanding that a shirt cut wrong will twist and bind no matter how well it's sewn. Pattern making comes later - the geometric puzzle of transforming flat cloth into shapes that fit curved bodies. Master tailors can drape cloth directly on a client, cutting and pinning to create custom patterns, but that skill takes years to develop.

The best tailors develop reputations that bring commissions from distant clients. A noble might travel three days to visit a master tailor known for perfect fits. Adventurers seek tailors who can create cloth armor that protects without restricting movement. Mages require robes cut to accommodate dramatic gestures while maintaining dignity. And everyone, from farmers to royalty, appreciates clothing that makes them look and feel their best.
