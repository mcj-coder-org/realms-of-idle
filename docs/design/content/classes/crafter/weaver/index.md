# Weaver

## Lore

### Origin

Before there were tailors, there were weavers. Every thread in every garment, every sheet on every bed, every sail on every ship - all began with someone sitting at a loom, passing shuttle through warp, creating fabric from nothing but fiber and patience. Weaving predates writing in most cultures; the patterns encoded in cloth told stories before alphabets existed.

The great weaving traditions developed independently across the world. Northern clans wove thick woolens on massive looms, their patterns recording family history. Southern desert peoples created gauze-thin linens that breathed in scorching heat. The elves perfected silk weaving, their fabric so fine it seemed woven from starlight. Dwarves focused on durability, their canvas and duck cloth lasting generations. Each tradition guards its secrets jealously while admitting the others have their own genius.

The Weavers' Guild maintains strict standards for apprentices. Before touching a loom, students spend months learning to spin - transforming raw fiber into thread. Only when their thread runs true and even do they advance to weaving itself. A master weaver can look at cloth and know exactly how it was made: the type of loom, the skill of the weaver, even the region where the technique originated.

### In the World

Weavers work in rhythm. The shuttle passes, the beater strikes, the treadles shift - a dance that hypnotizes with its repetition. Experienced weavers enter meditative states, their hands moving automatically while their minds wander. Some claim their best ideas come at the loom, problems solving themselves in the space between thread and thought.

Every village needs a weaver. Cloth wears out constantly - babies need swaddling, workers need shirts, households need linens. The village weaver knows everyone's needs: who's expecting, who's marrying, who needs mourning black. They plan seasons ahead, spinning in winter, warping in spring, weaving through summer and fall. The rhythm of the loom becomes the rhythm of the community.

Master weavers create fabrics that seem impossible. Double-weave blankets with different patterns on each side. Damask tablecloths where the pattern emerges from texture alone. Tapestries depicting scenes so detailed they rival paintings. And for those with magical inclinations, fabrics woven with enchantment in the very thread, spells bound into the pattern itself.
