# Enchanter

## Lore

### The Art of Enchantment

Enchanters are masters of a rare and valuable discipline: infusing ordinary crafted items with magical properties. While Mages study abstract magical theory and Crafters master the art of creation, Enchanters have mastered the intersection—understanding both how magic flows and how to bind it permanently into physical objects.

### Artisans of Power

In any prosperous settlement, Enchanters are highly valued professionals. Nobles commission enchanted armor, merchants desire magical trade goods, and adventurers seek out enchanted weapons. An Enchanter's workshop is a place of prestige and profit, where magical and mundane crafts merge into items of legendary quality.
