# Consolidation Classes

Consolidation classes are **Tier 3 classes** formed by combining two base classes. They represent a character's mastery of two complementary disciplines and unlock access to advanced abilities and synergies not available to single-class characters.

## Overview

| Class                     | Prerequisites    | Tier | Description                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Enchanter](./enchanter/) | Mage + Crafter   | 3    | Magical item specialist who imbues crafted goods with enchantments    |
| [Healer](./healer/)       | Mage + Herbalist | 3    | Healing specialist combining magical restoration with herbal remedies |

## How Consolidation Works

### Prerequisites

To achieve a consolidation class, a character must:

1. Master both prerequisite base classes
2. Accumulate **50,000 XP** from actions related to both disciplines
3. Complete class-specific achievements

### Tag Access

Consolidation classes gain **dual tag path access**:

- Characters accessing recipes, spells, or crafts use the DEEPEST matching tag from either path
- Example: **Enchanter** has access to both `Magic` (from Mage) and `Crafting` (from Crafter) tags
- Recipes tagged at these depths become visible and accessible with full synergy bonuses

### Benefits

- **Synergy Bonuses:** +50-100% effectiveness when combining disciplines
- **Expanded Recipe Access:** See and craft recipes from both parent classes
- **Unique Skills:** Start with special abilities unavailable to single classes
- **Cross-Discipline Knowledge:** Understand interactions between two systems
