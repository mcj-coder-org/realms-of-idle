# Healer

## Lore

### The Dual Path

Healers represent the union of magical and natural healing arts. While Mages study the arcane
principles of restoration magic and Herbalists master the chemical and medicinal properties of
plants, Healers have achieved mastery in both disciplines, understanding how magic and
herbalism complement each other.

### Role in Society

Healers serve as premier medical practitioners in civilized settlements. Unlike shamans who
work within tribal contexts, Healers operate in structured societies where their combined
expertise makes them invaluable to nobles, merchants, and common folk alike. A skilled Healer
commands respect and compensation befitting their crucial role.
