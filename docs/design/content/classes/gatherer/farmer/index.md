# Farmer

## Lore

### Origin

Agriculture transformed humanity from wanderers to settlers, from survivors to civilizers. The moment someone planted a seed intentionally and tended it to harvest, civilization became possible. Farming freed people from constant food-gathering, allowing specialization - some could farm while others crafted, traded, or governed. Every city, every kingdom, every achievement of civilization rests on foundations laid by Farmers.

Farming knowledge accumulated slowly across millennia. Which plants grow in which soils. When to plant for best yields. How to rotate crops to maintain soil health. Which animals adapt to domestication. How weather patterns affect harvests. This wisdom passes through generations, parents teaching children in fields and barns, grandparents sharing hard-won insights. Each region develops techniques suited to local conditions - irrigation in dry lands, terracing on slopes, raised beds in wetlands.

The Farmers' Guild promotes agricultural innovation while preserving traditional knowledge. They sponsor crop experiments, organize harvest festivals, mediate water rights disputes, and maintain seed banks. Farming feeds nations, so Farmers wield quiet but real political power. A poor harvest means hungry cities and desperate nobles. Farmers who consistently deliver surplus become wealthy and respected.

### In the World

Farming dominates rural landscapes everywhere. Rolling fields of grain. Orchards heavy with fruit. Vegetable gardens in neat rows. Pastures dotted with livestock. The rhythms of farm life structure rural communities - planting in spring, tending through summer, harvesting in autumn, maintaining through winter. These cycles repeat with comforting predictability, though weather and pests ensure no two years are identical.

Farm work is hard, physical labor from dawn to dusk during busy seasons. Plowing fields. Planting seeds. Weeding rows. Watering crops. Harvesting yields. Tending animals. Repairing fences. Maintaining equipment. The work never truly ends - there's always something demanding attention. Successful Farmers develop incredible endurance, waking before sunrise and working until dark during critical periods.

Different specializations exist within farming. Grain farmers cultivate wheat, barley, rye, oats. Vegetable farmers grow food for immediate consumption. Orchardists tend fruit trees for years before first harvest. Livestock farmers raise cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens. Most farms combine multiple specialties - grain fields, vegetable gardens, fruit trees, and animals working together in integrated systems.

Apprentice Farmers learn through doing. Following elders through daily tasks. Planting seeds at proper depths and spacing. Judging when crops need water or feed. Recognizing plant diseases and pest damage. Understanding animal health and behavior. Reading weather signs. Managing resources. The knowledge seems simple until you try - knowing when soil is ready for plowing, when fruit is perfectly ripe, when livestock needs different feed mixes takes years to internalize.

Farm communities develop strong bonds through shared labor. Neighbors help with barn raisings, harvest crews, and crisis situations. Harvest festivals celebrate successful yields and give thanks for abundance. Village markets connect farmers with craftspeople and merchants. Despite hard work and uncertain income, many Farmers wouldn't trade their lives for anything - working land their families have farmed for generations, producing food that sustains entire communities, living close to natural cycles.

#### Synergy Skills

Skills that have strong synergies with Farmer. These skills can be learned by any character, but Farmers gain significant bonuses (2x XP acquisition, enhanced effectiveness, reduced costs). Higher Farmer levels provide stronger synergy bonuses.

**Gathering Skills**:

- [Green Thumb](../../skills/tiered/green-thumb.md) - Lesser/Greater/Enhanced - Crops grow faster
- [Soil Sense](../../skills/index.md) - Lesser/Greater/Enhanced - Judge soil quality
- [Efficient Planting](../../skills/index.md) - Lesser/Greater/Enhanced - Chance to save seeds when planting
- [Crop Rotation](../../skills/index.md) - Lesser/Greater/Enhanced - Rotated fields yield more
- [Weather Reading](../../skills/common/index.md) - Lesser/Greater/Enhanced - Predict weather ahead
- [Pest Control](../../skills/index.md) - Lesser/Greater/Enhanced - Reduce pest damage
- [Quality Harvest](../../skills/index.md) - Lesser/Greater/Enhanced - Harvested crops higher quality
- [Irrigation Master](../../skills/index.md) - Lesser/Greater/Enhanced - Reduce water needs
- [Rapid Harvest](../../skills/index.md) - Lesser/Greater/Enhanced - Reduced harvest time
- [Seed Selection](../../skills/index.md) - Lesser/Greater/Enhanced - Save seeds that produce better crops
- [Fertilization](../../skills/index.md) - Lesser/Greater/Enhanced - Apply fertilizer for yield boost
- [Exotic Crops](../../skills/index.md) - No tiers - Can grow rare and magical plants

**Animal Skills**:

- [Animal Husbandry](../../skills/tiered/animal-husbandry.md) - Lesser/Greater/Enhanced - Livestock production increased
- [Hardy Breeds](../../skills/index.md) - Lesser/Greater/Enhanced - Livestock resist disease better

**Note**: All skills listed have strong synergies because they are core farming skills. Characters without Farmer class can still learn these skills but progress at base rate (1x XP) without effectiveness bonuses.

#### Synergy Bonuses

Farmer provides context-specific bonuses to farming-related skills based on logical specialization:

**Core Trade Skills** (Direct specialization - Strong synergy):

- **Green Thumb**: Essential for crop growth and yield
  - Faster learning: 2x XP from planting and tending actions (scales with class level)
  - Better effectiveness: +25% growth speed at Farmer 15, +35% at Farmer 30+
  - Reduced cost: -25% stamina at Farmer 15, -35% at Farmer 30+
- **Crop Rotation**: Directly tied to field management and soil health
  - Faster learning: 2x XP from field management actions
  - Better yield: +30% rotation bonus at Farmer 15
  - Lower depletion: -50% soil depletion rate
- **Animal Husbandry**: Core skill for livestock management
  - Faster learning: 2x XP from animal care actions
  - Better production: +20% livestock output at Farmer 15
  - Lower feed cost: -20% feed consumption

**Synergy Strength Scales with Class Level**:

| Farmer Level | XP Multiplier | Effectiveness Bonus | Cost Reduction | Example: Green Thumb |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| Level 5      | 1.5x (+50%)   | +15%                | -15% stamina   | Good but moderate    |
| Level 10     | 1.75x (+75%)  | +20%                | -20% stamina   | Strong improvements  |
| Level 15     | 2.0x (+100%)  | +25%                | -25% stamina   | Excellent synergy    |
| Level 30+    | 2.5x (+150%)  | +35%                | -35% stamina   | Masterful synergy    |

**Example Progression**:

A Farmer 15 learning Green Thumb:

- Performs 50 planting actions (earning 2x XP = 1000 XP total, vs 500 XP for non-Farmer)
- Green Thumb available at level-up after just 500 XP (vs 1500 XP for non-farming class)
- When using Green Thumb: Base +35% growth speed becomes +60% growth speed (base +25% synergy)
- Stamina cost: 7.5 stamina instead of 10 (25% reduction)
