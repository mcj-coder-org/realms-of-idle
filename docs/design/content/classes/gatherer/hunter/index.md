# Hunter

## Lore

### Origin

Humans hunted before they farmed, tracked prey before they built cities, understood animal behavior before they domesticated livestock. The Hunter's craft is ancient and primal, connecting modern practitioners to ancestors who survived by reading signs in disturbed earth and understanding the rhythms of wild creatures. Though civilization has softened some edges, the fundamental skills remain: patience, observation, respect for quarry, and clean kills.

Hunting means different things across cultures. In harsh climates, it represents survival - meat for winter, furs for warmth, bones for tools. In fertile regions, it supplements farmed foods and controls animal populations. For some, hunting is sport or tradition. Regardless of motivation, ethical Hunters follow similar principles: take only what you need, ensure quick deaths, use every part of the animal, and maintain sustainable populations for future generations.

The Hunters' Guild distinguishes between hunters and poachers. True Hunters respect game laws, avoid breeding seasons, target appropriate populations, and sell to legitimate markets. Poachers slaughter indiscriminately, waste carcasses for valuable parts, hunt protected species, and operate outside the law. Hunters view poachers as threats to their livelihood and the natural balance they work to maintain.

### In the World

Every settlement depends on Hunters to some degree. Villages prize the Hunter who reliably provides meat for winter stores. Cities employ Hunters to control dangerous animal populations - wolves that threaten livestock, bears that raid farms, giant rats in sewers. Luxury markets pay premium prices for rare furs, exotic meats, and specialty animal parts used in alchemy or magical crafting.

The Hunter's work varies by season and terrain. Forest Hunters track deer, boar, and small game through dense undergrowth. Mountain Hunters brave heights and cold for ibex, mountain lions, and eagles. Plains Hunters range far, following migratory herds. Coastal Hunters know tides and habits of sea mammals. Each environment demands specialized knowledge and techniques.

Some Hunters work alone, preferring solitude and keeping all profits. Others form partnerships or small crews, sharing labor and watching each other's backs in dangerous territory. Pack Hunters coordinate to bring down large or dangerous game - mammoth in frozen north, basilisk in badlands, wyvern in mountain peaks. These hunts require planning, specialized equipment, and absolute trust in your fellow Hunters.

Apprentice Hunters learn by following masters, absorbing knowledge through observation and practice. Reading tracks - identifying species, estimating size, determining direction and age. Understanding behavior - where animals feed, water, rest, and breed. Mastering weapons - bows for distance, spears for reach, knives for close work. Developing patience - hours of stillness waiting for the perfect shot. Learning field dressing - efficiently processing kills to preserve meat and hide quality.

The Hunt itself becomes almost meditative for experienced practitioners. Moving through wilderness with heightened awareness, every sense engaged. Spotting subtle signs others miss - broken twigs, disturbed moss, faint scents on wind. Anticipating prey behavior to position advantageously. Making the shot or strike with practiced precision. Honoring the kill with efficient use of every part. Good Hunters develop deep respect for the animals they hunt, understanding they play a role in natural cycles.

#### Synergy Skills

Skills that have strong synergies with Hunter. These skills can be learned by any character, but Hunters gain significant bonuses (2x XP acquisition, enhanced effectiveness, reduced costs). Higher Hunter levels provide stronger synergy bonuses.

**Gathering Skills**:

- [Tracking](../../skills/index.md) - Lesser/Greater/Enhanced - Follow trails of varying ages
- [Keen Senses](../../skills/common/keen-senses/index.md) - Lesser/Greater/Enhanced - Increased detection range for animals
- [Clean Kill](../../skills/index.md) - Lesser/Greater/Enhanced - Chance for instant kill with higher material quality
- [Field Dressing](../../skills/index.md) - Lesser/Greater/Enhanced - Process carcasses faster with better yield
- [Trap Setting](../../skills/tiered/index.md) - Lesser/Greater/Enhanced - Set traps that catch various game sizes
- [Animal Behavior](../../skills/index.md) - Lesser/Greater/Enhanced - Predict animal actions
- [Dangerous Game](../../skills/index.md) - Lesser/Greater/Enhanced - Hunt dangerous creatures more effectively
- [Territory Knowledge](../../skills/index.md) - Lesser/Greater/Enhanced - Know animal territories
- [Exotic Quarry](../../skills/index.md) - No tiers - Can track and hunt magical creatures
- [Mercy Kill](../../skills/index.md) - Lesser/Greater/Enhanced - Wounded animals die peacefully without wasting materials

**Note**: All skills listed have strong synergies because they are core hunting skills. Characters without Hunter class can still learn these skills but progress at base rate (1x XP) without effectiveness bonuses.

#### Synergy Bonuses

Hunter provides context-specific bonuses to hunting-related skills based on logical specialization:

**Core Trade Skills** (Direct specialization - Strong synergy):

- **Tracking**: Essential for locating and following prey
  - Faster learning: 2x XP from hunting and tracking actions (scales with class level)
  - Better effectiveness: +25% track reading accuracy at Hunter 15, +35% at Hunter 30+
  - Reduced cost: -25% time to analyze tracks at Hunter 15, -35% at Hunter 30+
- **Animal Behavior**: Directly tied to predicting prey movements
  - Faster learning: 2x XP from observation and stalking
  - Better prediction: +30% accuracy at Hunter 15
  - Lower surprise: -50% chance of prey alerting
- **Field Dressing**: Core skill for processing kills efficiently
  - Faster learning: 2x XP from processing carcasses
  - Better yield: +20% material recovery at Hunter 15
  - Lower waste: -20% spoilage time

**Synergy Strength Scales with Class Level**:

| Hunter Level | XP Multiplier | Effectiveness Bonus | Cost Reduction | Example: Tracking   |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| Level 5      | 1.5x (+50%)   | +15%                | -15% time      | Good but moderate   |
| Level 10     | 1.75x (+75%)  | +20%                | -20% time      | Strong improvements |
| Level 15     | 2.0x (+100%)  | +25%                | -25% time      | Excellent synergy   |
| Level 30+    | 2.5x (+150%)  | +35%                | -35% time      | Masterful synergy   |

**Example Progression**:

A Hunter 15 learning Tracking:

- Performs 50 tracking actions (earning 2x XP = 1000 XP total, vs 500 XP for non-Hunter)
- Tracking available at level-up after just 500 XP (vs 1500 XP for non-hunting class)
- When using Tracking: Base ancient trail reading becomes +25% more accurate (base +25% synergy)
- Time cost: 7.5 minutes instead of 10 minutes to read tracks (25% reduction)
