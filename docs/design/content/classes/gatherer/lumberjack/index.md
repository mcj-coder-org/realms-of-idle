# Lumberjack

## Lore

### Origin

Trees built the world before stone or metal - shelter from rain, fuel for fire, boats to cross water, weapons for defense. The Lumberjack's craft is as old as axes themselves, born when humans realized that felled trees provided superior materials to gathered branches. From simple tree-cutting evolved sophisticated forestry - understanding growth patterns, judging timber quality, predicting how trees will fall, processing logs efficiently.

Different cultures approach forestry differently. Northern peoples harvest conifers for straight building lumber and aromatic oils. Tropical regions work with hardwoods dense enough to sink in water. Temperate forests provide varied species - oak for strength, ash for flexibility, cherry for beauty. Dwarves consider timber harvesting almost disrespectful compared to mining but grudgingly admit its necessity. Elves practice selective forestry, taking only what grows back quickly while preserving ancient groves.

The Lumberjacks' Guild promotes sustainable forestry learned from witnessing deforested wastelands. Clear-cutting destroys watersheds, erodes soil, and eliminates wildlife habitat. Responsible Lumberjacks practice selective harvesting - taking mature trees while leaving younger ones to grow, maintaining forest health for future generations. Plant three trees for every one felled, and never cut an ancient grove unless no alternative exists.

### In the World

Civilization demands constant wood supplies. Homes require timber frameworks. Ships need massive quantities of quality lumber. Mines need support beams. Cities need fuel for heating and cooking. Carpenters, coopers, wheelwrights, shipwrights - countless trades depend on Lumberjacks providing steady timber flows. Without wood, construction halts and people freeze in winter.

Logging camps cluster in forested regions, temporary settlements housing crews during harvest seasons. The work is dangerous - falling trees kill careless workers, rolling logs crush the unlucky, sawdust damages lungs, axes slip with bloody consequences. Safety protocols exist but accidents happen. Old Lumberjacks often carry scars and missing fingers as marks of their trade.

Different harvesting methods suit different needs. Clear-cutting removes entire forest sections - fast, efficient, devastating to ecosystems. Selective logging takes individual trees - slower, sustainable, requiring more skill. Coppicing harvests regrowth from stumps - renewable but limited. Forestry management balances immediate needs against long-term supply, satisfying neither those who want maximum profit nor those who want untouched wilderness.

Apprentice Lumberjacks start with basic tasks - limbing felled trees, stacking lumber, maintaining equipment. They progress to tree identification, learning which species suit different purposes. Oak for barrels and ships, pine for quick construction, ash for tool handles, cherry for fine furniture. They develop strength and stamina through constant physical labor. Eventually they learn the most critical skill - felling trees precisely where intended without injury.

The rhythmic swing of axes and rasp of two-man saws creates logging camps' distinctive soundscape. Trees crash with ground-shaking impacts. Teamsters shout at oxen hauling massive logs. Sawyers curse as blades bind in wet wood. Evening brings exhaustion, hearty meals, and the satisfaction of honest labor. Lumberjacks develop tight camaraderie - when trees fall, you trust your crew to keep you alive.

**Core Trade Skills** (Direct specialization - Strong synergy):

- **Powerful Swing**: Essential for efficient tree felling
  - Faster learning: 2x XP from chopping actions (scales with class level)
  - Better effectiveness: +25% swing speed at Lumberjack 15, +35% at Lumberjack 30+
  - Reduced cost: -25% stamina at Lumberjack 15, -35% at Lumberjack 30+
- **Precision Felling**: Directly tied to safe and controlled tree dropping
  - Faster learning: 2x XP from felling actions
  - Better accuracy: +30% directional control at Lumberjack 15

**Example Progression**:

A Lumberjack 15 learning Powerful Swing:

- Performs 50 chopping actions (earning 2x XP = 1000 XP total, vs 500 XP for non-Lumberjack)
- Powerful Swing available at level-up after just 500 XP (vs 1500 XP for non-logging class)
- When using Powerful Swing: Base -50% time becomes -75% time (base +25% synergy)
- Stamina cost: 7.5 stamina instead of 10 stamina per tree (25% reduction)
