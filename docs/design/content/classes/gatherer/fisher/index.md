# Fisher

## Lore

### Origin

Where water meets hunger, Fishers find their calling. From the first human who fashioned a bone hook and tied it to plant fiber, fishing has fed coastal and riverside communities. The craft evolved from simple hooks and nets to sophisticated techniques adapted to countless species and environments. Some fish bite hooks eagerly, others require perfect presentation. Some gather in predictable schools, others follow mysterious patterns only experienced Fishers understand.

Fishing knowledge is local and specific. A master of river fishing might struggle in ocean waters. Someone who excels at net fishing may fail with rod and line. Coastal Fishers know tides and currents. Lake Fishers understand seasonal depth changes. Ice Fishers brave frozen surfaces for winter catches. Each environment and technique represents specialized knowledge accumulated through generations of observation and experimentation.

The Fishers' Guild promotes sustainable practices learned from witnessing depleted waters. Overfishing destroys future harvests. Keeping undersized fish prevents population recovery. Fishing during spawning seasons decimates next year's stock. Responsible Fishers take only what they need, release breeding stock, and rotate fishing grounds to allow recovery. Short-term greed creates long-term hunger for everyone.

### In the World

Fishing communities cluster along coastlines, rivers, and lakes wherever water provides reliable harvests. In seaside villages, the sound of waves mingles with fishmongers calling their wares. River towns celebrate salmon runs that bring annual abundance. Lake communities ice-fish through winter months when other food sources dwindle. Fishing provides not just food but livelihoods for entire families - some fish, some mend nets, some process catches, some sell at market.

The Fisher's life follows water rhythms rather than sun cycles. Ocean Fishers check tide tables and weather forecasts, heading out in early morning darkness to reach productive grounds. River Fishers know seasonal patterns - spring spawning runs, summer depths, autumn migrations. Lake Fishers understand how temperature layers affect where fish swim. Successful fishing requires being where fish are, when they're feeding, using appropriate bait or lures.

Different fishing methods suit different situations. Rod and line offers precision and sport, ideal for selective fishing. Nets catch large quantities but require sorting and release of unwanted species. Traps and weirs provide passive catching, checked daily. Spear fishing in clear shallow water targets specific fish. Each method requires distinct skills and knowledge. Most Fishers master multiple techniques, choosing based on target species and conditions.

Apprentice Fishers learn through exhausting days on water. Baiting hooks properly. Reading water to identify likely fishing spots. Feeling subtle bites through line. Setting nets without tangling. Gutting and cleaning catches efficiently. Understanding which fish are valuable, which are trash, which are dangerous to handle. Knowledge accumulates slowly - why fish bite some days but not others, where to find them in different seasons, which techniques work for which species.

Weather dominates the Fisher's life. Strong winds make waters dangerous. Storms prevent ocean fishing entirely. Rain can improve or ruin fishing depending on species. Temperature affects fish behavior profoundly. Experienced Fishers read weather signs obsessively, planning around conditions. A skilled Fisher with bad weather timing catches nothing. A mediocre Fisher with perfect timing fills boats.

#### Synergy Skills

Skills that have strong synergies with Fisher. These skills can be learned by any character, but Fishers gain significant bonuses (2x XP acquisition, enhanced effectiveness, reduced costs). Higher Fisher levels provide stronger synergy bonuses.

**Gathering Skills**:

**Note**: All skills listed have strong synergies because they are core fishing skills. Characters without Fisher class can still learn these skills but progress at base rate (1x XP) without effectiveness bonuses.

#### Synergy Bonuses

Fisher provides context-specific bonuses to fishing-related skills based on logical specialization:

**Core Trade Skills** (Direct specialization - Strong synergy):

- **Water Reading**: Essential for locating productive fishing spots
  - Faster learning: 2x XP from fishing exploration actions (scales with class level)
  - Better effectiveness: +25% spot quality at Fisher 15, +35% at Fisher 30+
  - Reduced cost: -25% time to survey at Fisher 15, -35% at Fisher 30+
- **Patient Angler**: Directly tied to efficient fishing technique
  - Faster learning: 2x XP from hook fishing actions
  - Better speed: +30% time reduction at Fisher 15
  - Lower fatigue: -50% stamina cost during extended fishing
- **Net Mastery**: Core skill for net-based fishing
  - Faster learning: 2x XP from net fishing actions

| Level 30+    | 2.5x (+150%)  | +35%                | -35% time      | Masterful synergy      |

**Example Progression**:

A Fisher 15 learning Water Reading:

- Performs 50 fishing scouting actions (earning 2x XP = 1000 XP total, vs 500 XP for non-Fisher)
- Water Reading available at level-up after just 500 XP (vs 1500 XP for non-fishing class)
- When using Water Reading: Base perfect spot detection becomes +25% more accurate (base +25% synergy)
- Time cost: 7.5 minutes instead of 10 minutes to survey an area (25% reduction)
