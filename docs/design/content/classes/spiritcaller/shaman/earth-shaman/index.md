# Earth Shaman

## Lore

### Spirit Connection

Earth Shamans have developed profound connections with the ancient spirits of soil, stone, and root. These practitioners understand the earth as the foundation of all life - stable, patient, and enduring. They commune with spirits that remember geological ages and carry the accumulated wisdom of the land itself. For Earth Shamans, the ground beneath their feet is both literal and metaphorical foundation for their power.

### Tribal Role

Earth Shamans serve as healers and protectors in their communities, using their connection to earth spirits to fortify settlements, bless crops, and treat injuries grounded in physical stability. They understand the land's cycles and help their tribes navigate changes in terrain and climate. Many Earth Shamans also work as miners or builders, using their shamanic knowledge to work safely with stone and soil.
