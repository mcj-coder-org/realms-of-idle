# Totem Carver

## Lore

### Sacred Carving

Totem Carvers are spiritual artisans who have mastered the sacred art of creating permanent totems. While regular Shamans create temporary charms and Carpenters work with mundane wood, Totem Carvers merge these skills into a profound practice: carving wooden totems that serve as permanent vessels for spirit power.

### Tribal Legacy

In tribal societies, Totem Carvers hold prestigious positions. The totems they create become central to tribal identity, serving as focal points for protective rituals, ancestral memory, and spiritual power. A great Totem Carver's work can outlast generations, blessing their tribe with lasting spiritual protection.
