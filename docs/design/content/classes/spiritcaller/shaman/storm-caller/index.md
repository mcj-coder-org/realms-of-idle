# Storm Caller

## Lore

### Spirit Connection

Storm Callers have developed a volatile and thrilling bond with the tempestuous spirits of lightning and storm. These shamans walk the razor's edge between chaos and control, communing with entities of raw energy and overwhelming power. They understand storms as both destructive force and purifying blessing - the thunder that speaks truth, the lightning that strikes corruption, and the rains that nourish the land.

### Tribal Role

Storm Callers serve as protectors and judges in their tribes, their connection to storm spirits giving them authority in matters of justice and judgment. They perform lightning rituals to purify sacred grounds and call upon storm spirits to break droughts or subdue floods. During dangerous travels through mountain passes, Storm Callers negotiate with tempests for safe passage. Their role is dangerous but vital to tribal survival in harsh environments.
