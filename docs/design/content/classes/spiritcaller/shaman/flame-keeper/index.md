# Flame Keeper

## Lore

### Spirit Connection

Flame Keepers have forged profound bonds with the spirits of fire and warmth that dwell in the tribal lands. Their communion with sacred flames goes beyond mere control - they are chosen conduits for the spirits of hearth, transformation, and purification. These shamans understand fire not as destruction but as blessing - the warmth that sustains life, the light that drives back darkness, and the sacred element that transforms raw materials into tools and food.

### Tribal Role

Within their tribes, Flame Keepers hold special responsibility for maintaining the eternal tribal fire - the sacred flames that warm the gathering place, cook food, and serve as the spiritual anchor of community. During ceremonies, they call upon fire spirits to purify spaces and people. In times of hardship, their communion with warmth spirits sustains the tribe's hope. Many Flame Keepers also serve as blacksmiths or hearth-masters, roles that blend practical fire management with shamanic spiritual work.
