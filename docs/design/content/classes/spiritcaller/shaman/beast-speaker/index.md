# Beast Speaker

## Lore

### Spirit Connection

Beast Speakers have forged powerful bonds with the spirits of animals - the courage of predators, the cunning of foxes, the loyalty of wolves, and the strength of bears. These shamans understand that humanity is not separate from the animal world but part of it. They develop a unique perspective on survival, community, and primal wisdom. Through their communion with animal spirits, they gain insights that go beyond human reasoning.

### Tribal Role

Beast Speakers serve as hunters, scouts, and protectors for their communities. Their ability to communicate with animal spirits and occasionally take on animal forms makes them invaluable for hunting expeditions and defense. Many tribes view Beast Speakers as mediators between civilized human society and the wild. They often train animal companions, negotiate with dangerous beasts, and serve as spiritual guides for those seeking to understand their animal nature.
