# War Shaman

## Lore

### Battle Spirits

War Shamans are spiritual warriors who have mastered the art of channeling battle spirits in combat. While regular Shamans commune with nature and ancestral spirits for wisdom and healing, War Shamans forge bonds with aggressive, martial spirits that amplify their combat abilities and inspire their tribal warriors.

### Tribal Protector

In tribal societies, War Shamans serve as both spiritual leaders and battlefield commanders. They fight alongside warriors while channeling protective and offensive spirit magic, making them invaluable in tribal conflicts and hunts. A tribe blessed with a War Shaman's protection feels the favor of the spirit world itself.
