# Ancestor Shaman

## Lore

### Spirit Connection

Ancestor Shamans have opened channels to the spirits of their lineage - the accumulated wisdom, experience, and power of all who came before. These shamans understand that the boundary between life and death is permeable and that ancestors remain present to guide and protect their descendants. They develop profound respect for the cycle of life and death, learning to negotiate with spirits who exist beyond the mortal veil.

### Tribal Role

Ancestor Shamans serve as the living memory of their tribes, channeling ancestral wisdom for important decisions and guidance. They perform rituals to honor the deceased, ensure peaceful transitions to the spirit world, and maintain the connection between living tribe members and their ancestors. Many serve as historians, record-keepers, and funeral conductors, using their shamanic knowledge to manage the spiritual and practical aspects of death and remembrance.
