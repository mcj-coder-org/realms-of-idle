# Wind Walker

## Lore

### Spirit Connection

Wind Walkers commune with the free and untamed spirits of air, breeze, and the endless sky. These shamans understand wind as both gentle guide and powerful force - the breath of life, the messenger between worlds, and the symbol of freedom and change. They develop a unique relationship with movement itself, learning to move more swiftly through shamanic communion with wind spirits.

### Tribal Role

Wind Walkers serve as scouts, traders, and messengers for their tribes. Their connection to wind spirits allows them to travel safely through dangerous territories and to carry messages across vast distances. During tribal councils, they are consulted for matters of long journeys and expeditions. Many Wind Walkers also function as hunters, using their speed and air sense to track prey effectively.
