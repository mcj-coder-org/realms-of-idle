# Frost Shaman

## Lore

### Spirit Connection

Frost Shamans commune with the spirits of ice, winter, and the frozen depths. They understand cold not as merely the absence of heat, but as a living spiritual force - the crystalline clarity of frozen water, the preservative power of winter, and the ancient wisdom held in glaciers. These shamans walk between worlds of fire and ice, learning to harness the spirits of cold while maintaining their own inner warmth.

### Tribal Role

In communities that face harsh winters, Frost Shamans are invaluable as they negotiate with winter spirits for merciful seasons and channel ice spirits to preserve food and cool fevers. They maintain magical refrigeration chambers using ice spirit bonds and create protective barriers of ice during defense rituals. Their knowledge of permafrost and glacial preservation extends to both practical hunting and spiritual practice.
