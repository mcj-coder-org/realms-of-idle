# Shaman

## Lore

### Origin

Shamans are the spiritual anchors of their tribes - practitioners who have transcended the basic spirit communion of Spiritcallers to become full intermediaries between the material and spirit worlds. Where Spiritcallers first sense the spirits, Shamans develop genuine relationships with them, learning to draw directly from the collective spirit pool rather than channeling personal energy.

The path to Shamanism requires more than magical talent. It demands spiritual maturity, wisdom earned through experience, and deep respect for both worlds and the responsibilities of connecting them. Shamans undergo rigorous training in spirit protocols, learning when and how to call upon the spirit realm, understanding the debt incurred by drawing spirit power, and developing the charisma necessary to negotiate between spirits and mortals.

Unlike academic Mages who study magic as a system of knowledge, Shamans are empiricists and traditionalists. They learn from experienced shamans, from ancestral spirits themselves, and from direct experience with the natural and supernatural worlds. Their magic is inseparable from practical skills - herbalism is not a separate profession but part of shamanic practice, healing flows naturally from their connection to spirits of vitality and health, and charm-making is both art and spiritual negotiation.

### In the World

In tribal communities, Shamans hold positions of deep respect and significant responsibility. They serve as healers, advisors, spiritual leaders, and mediaries during important decisions. When famine threatens, the Shaman consults the earth spirits. When illness strikes, the Shaman reads the spirits' message in the symptoms and prescribes both herbal remedies and spiritual remedies. When conflict arises, the Shaman's wisdom and connection to ancestral guidance helps resolve it.

Shamans are expected to maintain balance - between the spirit and material worlds, between themselves and the spirits they work with, between personal desires and tribal needs. A Shaman who takes without giving back, who makes demands of spirits without reciprocation, or who uses their power for selfish purposes risks spiritual corruption - becoming increasingly out of touch with the spirits until they lose their power entirely or worse, unlocks eligibility for conduit for malevolent forces.

Shamanic practice varies widely across different regions and tribes. Some focus on ancestral communion, others on elemental spirits, still others on animal guides. Some Shamans develop specializations only after decades of practice, others follow a single shamanic path from their first connection. All, however, share certain fundamentals: respect for the spirit world, understanding of herbs and their properties, the ability to heal both body and spirit, and skill in creating charms that bridge the material and spirit worlds.

## Organizations

### Tribal Traditions

Shamans are the keepers of tribal tradition and spiritual knowledge. Each tribe's shamanic lineage traces back through generations, with knowledge passed down through apprenticeship and direct teaching. Shamans maintain the tribe's relationship with the spirit world, ensuring proper offerings are made, taboos are respected, and balance is maintained. A tribe without a Shaman is considered spiritually vulnerable - exposed to malevolent spirits and unable to benefit from benevolent ones.

Shamanic training often begins in childhood but doesn't formally lead to the Shaman class until years of study and practice. The progression from Spiritcaller to Shaman marks a turning point - when a person's commitment to shamanic practice becomes undeniable and their competence reaches a recognized threshold. Different tribes have different markers for this transition, but all require demonstration of spiritual maturity and practical skill.

### Spirit Lodge

Most established shamans maintain a Spirit Lodge - a sacred space where shamanic work is performed. This might be a dedicated building, a cave, a forest clearing, or any location that shamans and the tribe recognize as spiritually significant. Within the Lodge, shamans commune with spirits, train apprentices, heal the seriously ill, and perform major rituals. The Lodge serves as the spiritual heart of the community.

Spirit Lodges accumulate spiritual power over time. Shamans who regularly perform rituals and maintain the space build stronger connections to local spirits, making their work more effective. Lodges that have been continuously maintained for generations become tremendously powerful spiritual nexus points. Conversely, abandoned or disrespected Lodges lose their spiritual potency and may attract unwanted spiritual attention.
