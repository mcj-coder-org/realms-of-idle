# Tide Caller

## Lore

### Spirit Connection

Tide Callers have bonded with the ever-flowing spirits of water - the rain that quenches, the rivers that carve paths, and the tides that govern maritime existence. These shamans understand water as the most adaptable element, flowing around obstacles while slowly shaping the world. They commune with spirits that embody patience, healing, and the life-giving essence of water itself.

### Tribal Role

Tide Callers are essential in any community connected to water - whether coastal, riverine, or in regions where water scarcity is a concern. They locate water sources through communion with water spirits, bless fishing expeditions, and use water magic for healing and purification. Many Tide Callers also work as healers, diviners, or river guides, using their shamanic knowledge to navigate water and life's changes.
