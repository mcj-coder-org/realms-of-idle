# Spirit Walker

## Lore

### Spirit Connection

Spirit Walkers have achieved the highest form of shamanic development - the ability to perceive and navigate the spirit realm itself. These shamans have learned to separate their consciousness from their physical bodies and travel through dream and spirit dimensions. They commune with spirits that exist outside normal time and space, gaining perspectives and knowledge unavailable to other shamans.

### Tribal Role

Spirit Walkers serve as the ultimate seekers of wisdom for their tribes. They undertake vision quests to discover answers to impossible questions, navigate spiritual crises, and commune with the highest powers of the spirit world. During times of great uncertainty or danger, tribes turn to Spirit Walkers to divine the future and understand the spiritual dimensions of events. Many also serve as teachers and guides for others learning shamanic practice, having achieved mastery of the craft.
