# Spiritcaller

## Lore

### The Calling

The Spiritcaller represents the awakening of connection to the spirit world - the moment when a person first senses the presence of spirits and learns to communicate with them. Before mastering shamanic arts, every tribal magic user must first become a Spiritcaller: understanding the nature of spirits, learning basic communion, and opening their soul to the spirit realm.

Spiritcallers emerge when spiritual sensitivity manifests. The child who speaks to ancestors in dreams. The hunter who senses animal spirits before the prey appears. The healer who instinctively knows which herbs the land spirits favor. The spirit world chooses them, and they choose to develop the connection.

Tribal elders begin all shamanic training with Spiritcaller basics. Spirit sensing, basic communion exercises, ritual protocols, and safety practices. These fundamentals protect both the caller and the spirits while building the foundation for specialized practice.

### In Tribal Society

Every tribe recognizes Spiritcallers as the first step of shamanic development. These individuals occupy a unique position - not yet full shamans, but already touched by the spirit world. They assist experienced shamans in rituals, learn ritual protocols, and begin understanding their place in the spiritual hierarchy.

A Spiritcaller's development determines their future path. Some will become generalist shamans, maintaining the whole of tribal spiritual practice. Others will specialize, becoming healers focused on spirit-blessed medicine, diviners who commune with ancestral spirits, or warriors who channel battle spirits.
