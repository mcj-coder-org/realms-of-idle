# Cattle

## Lore

### Origin

Cattle represent one of humanity's oldest and most successful partnerships with the animal kingdom. From the massive auroch herds that once roamed wild grasslands, patient generations of farmers developed the diverse cattle breeds that now form the foundation of agricultural prosperity. Every civilization has cattle - or had them, before other livestock proved better suited to local conditions.

The relationship between farmer and cattle is fundamentally different from that between rider and horse. Horses are partners; cattle are dependents. They trust humans to provide food, shelter, and protection, offering in return their milk, their meat, their hides, and their patient labor. A dairy cow that produces for a decade becomes part of the family, known by name and mourned when age finally takes her.

Different regions favor different cattle types. The mountain folk breed small, hardy cattle that thrive on sparse pasture and navigate steep slopes. Plains farmers raise massive beasts that produce prodigious amounts of milk or meat. Southern ranchers manage vast herds of semi-wild longhorns that can survive on scrubland. Each breed represents centuries of selection for traits that match local needs and conditions.

### In the World

Walk through any farming village at dawn and you'll hear the lowing of cattle, the sound of prosperity and stability. Milk pails clanking, butter churning, cheese aging in cool cellars - these are the rhythms of cattle-keeping communities. A family with even one milk cow has security; a farmer with a herd has wealth.

The village commons, where cattle graze communally during the day before returning to individual barns at night, serves as the social heart of many communities. Children watching the herd play together, young people court while ostensibly keeping guard, and adults discuss local matters. The pasture superintendent - often an elder who knows every animal by sight - holds a position of real authority.

Cattle economics shape kingdoms. Wars have been fought over grazing rights. Trade routes follow cattle trails. Cities depend on steady supplies of beef and dairy. The butcher, the dairyman, the leather tanner, the glue maker - all depend on cattle, making the animals integral to countless livelihoods beyond just farming.

Not all cattle are domestic. In some remote regions, feral cattle herds roam, descendants of escaped or released animals. These semi-wild populations fascinate rangers and trouble farmers - they compete with domestic herds for grazing, yet represent a genetic reservoir should domestic breeding become too narrow. Some cultures consider them sacred, others hunt them as game.
