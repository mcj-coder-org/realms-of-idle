# Domestic Animals

Animals that have lived alongside humanity for so long that neither species remembers a time before the partnership. These creatures form the backbone of agricultural society, providing transportation, food, labor, and companionship.

## Importance to Settlement Life

### Economic Foundation

Domestic animals represent the primary form of wealth for most rural communities:

**Wealth Indicators:**

- Large herds = prosperity
- Quality breeding stock = status
- Diverse animal holdings = stability
- Well-cared animals = good management

**Trade Commodities:**

- Milk, cheese, butter from cattle/goats
- Eggs from chickens/ducks
- Wool from sheep
- Leather from cattle/pigs
- Meat from all types

### Labor and Transportation

**Transportation:**

- Horses for riding and light hauling
- Oxen for heavy plowing and pulling
- Donkeys for pack transport in mountains
- Mules for endurance work

**Agricultural Labor:**

- Plowing fields (oxen, horses)
- Hauling harvests (cattle, horses)
- Manure for fertilizer (all animals)
- Pest control (chickens, ducks, cats)

### Food Security

**Daily Production:**

- Milk (cattle, goats) - daily without killing animal
- Eggs (chickens, ducks) - daily resource
- Meat (all types) - slaughter as needed

**Preservation Methods:**

- Cheese from milk (stores months)
- Salted/smoked meat (stores months)
- Pickled eggs (stores weeks)

### Social and Cultural Role

**Community Structure:**

- Shared grazing commons
- Cooperative animal care
- Breeding exchanges between farms
- Knowledge passing (animal husbandry skills)

**Milestones:**

- First horse = coming of age
- First breeding pair = marriage gift
- Inheritance of herds = family wealth transfer

## Care and Management

### Daily Requirements

| Animal Type | Feed Cost/Day | Water Need | Labor Time | Shelter Need |
| ----------- | ------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Horse       | 10-20 lbs hay | 15 gallons | 2-3 hours  | Stable       |
| Cattle      | Grazing/hay   | 20 gallons | 2-4 hours  | Barn         |
| Chicken     | Handful grain | Shared     | 30 min     | Coop         |
| Dog         | 1-3 lbs food  | 1-2 quarts | 1-2 hours  | Dog house    |

### Seasonal Considerations

**Spring:**

- Birth season for most animals
- Increased feed needs (lactation)
- Move to pasture from winter housing
- Shearing sheep, grooming horses

**Summer:**

- Peak grazing season
- Lower feed costs
- Abundant eggs and milk
- Breeding season for some species

**Autumn:**

- Prepare winter food stores
- Slaughter excess stock
- Final breeding before winter
- Move animals to winter quarters

**Winter:**

- Highest feed costs
- Limited production
- Indoor housing most animals
- Increased labor (hauling feed/water)

## Breeding and Lifespan

### Reproduction Cycles

| Animal  | Gestation/Incubation | Litter/Clutch Size | Productive Years   |
| ------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Horse   | 11 months            | 1 foal             | 15-20 years        |
| Cattle  | 9 months             | 1 calf             | 10-15 years        |
| Chicken | 21 days              | 8-12 chicks        | 2-3 years (laying) |
| Dog     | 2 months             | 4-8 puppies        | 8-12 years         |

### Breeding Considerations

**Selective Breeding:**

- Choose best traits to pass on
- Avoid inbreeding problems
- Maintain breed characteristics
- Improve stock over generations

**Breeding Rights:**

- Stud fees for quality males
- Sharing breeding animals with neighbors
- Trading breeding stock between regions
- Maintaining breed registries (nobles/guilds)

## Integration with Game Systems

### Settlement Building

**Requirements:**

- Stable/barn structures
- Grazing pastures (1 acre per 2 large animals)
- Water sources
- Feed storage
- Fencing and enclosures

**Benefits:**

- Food production
- Wealth generation
- Trade commodities
- Labor resources

### Player Progression

**Homesteading Path:**

1. First chickens (self-sufficiency start)
2. Add guard dog (security)
3. Purchase riding horse (mobility)
4. Acquire cattle/goats (wealth building)
5. Expand herds (prosperity)

### Economy

**Market Dynamics:**

- Seasonal price fluctuations
- Quality grades affect value
- Disease outbreaks impact supply
- Regional specializations (horse-breeding regions, dairy regions)
