# Dog

## Lore

### Origin

Dogs were humanity's first ally, first guard, first hunting partner - the original compact between human and animal. So ancient is the bond that no one remembers its beginning. Dogs appear in the oldest stories, faithful at the sides of heroes and common folk alike. Every culture has dog myths, dog heroes, dog spirits watching over the living. This is not coincidence - dogs chose us, and we them, in the deepest reaches of prehistory.

Unlike other domestic animals bred for specific purposes, dogs evolved alongside humans as true partners. A herding dog doesn't just work sheep - it understands the task, makes decisions, takes pride in a job well done. A guard dog doesn't simply bark at strangers - it judges threats, protects its family, mourns when its people suffer. The relationship transcends utility, approaching something like friendship, or even love.

Different cultures developed distinct dog breeds to match their needs. The northern tribes bred massive war dogs that fight alongside warriors. Plains nomads favor swift hunting hounds. Mountain shepherds developed herding dogs of legendary intelligence. Nobles keep lapdogs as companions and status symbols. Each breed represents thousands of years of selection, but all retain that fundamental dog nature - loyalty to their humans, joy in serving, and an almost spiritual connection to our species.

### In the World

Walk through any settlement and you'll encounter dogs. Farm dogs that guard chickens and alert to visitors. Herding dogs that work cattle and sheep with minimal commands. Hunting dogs that track game through forests. Guard dogs that watch over homes and businesses. Companion dogs that provide comfort and joy. Each dog has a role, a purpose, a place in the community's fabric.

A good dog is worth more than gold to those who understand. Rangers pay fortunes for tracking hounds with proven lineage. Shepherds treasure their border collies above most possessions. Nobles compete to own the finest hunting breeds. But even the humblest mongrel, the stray that adopts a family, becomes irreplaceable. Dogs remember kindness, forgive flaws, and offer unconditional affection in a world often short on certainty.

The village dog, owned by none and befriended by all, occupies a special place. These community dogs warn of approaching strangers, play with children, accept scraps from multiple households. Their loyalty belongs to the whole settlement rather than a single master. When danger threatens - bandits, monsters, fires - these dogs' frantic barking has saved countless lives.

In practical terms, civilization would struggle without dogs. They guard flocks from wolves and bears. They hunt vermin that threaten grain stores. They track wounded game that would otherwise be lost. They pull small carts and sleds. They guide the blind and comfort the grieving. They teach children responsibility and empathy. The list of services dogs provide would fill volumes.
