# Horse

## Lore

### Origin

Horses and humanity have walked together for so long that neither remembers a time before the partnership. Every culture has its horse stories - how they were first tamed, which ancestor learned their language, what bargain was struck beneath ancient stars. What matters is that horses chose to join civilization, and in doing so, they changed everything.

The bond between human and horse transcends simple utility. A good horse knows its rider's moods better than most people do. They sense fear, confidence, anger, joy - and respond accordingly. Old cavalry officers claim a properly trained warhorse is worth three soldiers, not for its strength but for its judgment. Farmers say the same of plow horses, merchants of caravan horses, nobles of their thoroughbreds.

Different regions breed horses for different purposes, creating bloodlines as distinct as human cultures. The massive draft horses of the northern plains can pull loads that would break an ox. The desert coursers of the southern sands can run for days on minimal water. The mountain ponies navigate cliff paths that would terrify a goat. Each breed represents centuries of partnership, trust, and mutual adaptation.

### In the World

In any thriving community, you'll find horses. Knights ride them into battle and ceremony. Farmers work them in fields and orchards. Merchants move goods over roads and plains. Messengers carry urgent news across continents. Nobles display their wealth through breeding stock. Children dream of the day they'll have a horse of their own.

A settlement's horses tell you much about its prosperity. Well-fed, groomed horses indicate wealth and care. Overworked, underfed animals suggest desperation or cruelty. The village smithy is as much about shoeing horses as making tools. The stable master holds a position of trust and respect - these professionals know every horse in town, their temperaments, their ailments, their worth.

The economics of horses ripple through society. A quality riding horse costs what a craftsman earns in a year. A warhorse might be worth a small farm. This makes horse theft a capital crime in most kingdoms - stealing someone's horse isn't just theft, it's potentially life-destroying. Conversely, gifting someone a horse is among the highest honors, a gesture implying deep respect and trust.

Rangers speak of wild horse herds that roam the open grasslands, never tamed but aware of humanity. These free herds fascinate and frustrate would-be horse catchers - the wild horses are beautiful, fast, and utterly disinterested in domestication. Some cultures consider them sacred, believing they remember what it was like before the first bargain was made.
