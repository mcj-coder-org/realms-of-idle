# Chicken

## Lore

### Origin

Chickens are everywhere humans settle, so common that people forget what a remarkable creature they truly are. Descended from jungle fowl tamed thousands of years ago, these birds adapted to human companionship so thoroughly that wild chickens are now nearly mythical. Every farmstead, every village, every town has chickens - their morning crowing and afternoon clucking are the soundtrack of civilization.

The humble chicken represents democratic prosperity in a way no other animal can match. Kings and peasants alike keep chickens. They require minimal space, eat kitchen scraps, and produce eggs reliably. A family with a dozen laying hens never goes entirely hungry, and has valuable eggs to trade or sell. This makes chicken-keeping one of the first steps toward self-sufficiency for anyone starting a homestead.

Different cultures have developed distinct chicken breeds. The northern folk favor heavy, feather-footed birds that handle cold well. Southern regions breed sleek, heat-tolerant layers. Fighting cocks (kept only in regions where such things remain legal) bear little resemblance to their gentle laying hen cousins. Some nobles breed ornamental chickens with elaborate plumage, paying more for a decorative rooster than a farmer earns in a year.

### In the World

Wake in any rural settlement and the rooster's crow marks dawn more reliably than any clock. Throughout the day, chickens scratch and peck in yards, eating bugs, weeds, and scraps while producing eggs and manure. Children chase them, gathering warm eggs from nests and learning responsibility through daily coop chores. The chicken coop is often a child's first taste of animal husbandry.

Village economics run partly on eggs. A good laying hen produces 4-6 eggs weekly, and a dozen eggs trades for bread, vegetables, or other necessities. Bakers buy eggs in bulk, cooks prize them for recipes, and alchemists use them in certain preparations. The egg merchant makes regular rounds, paying fair prices for quality eggs and selling chicks in spring.

Butchered chickens provide quick protein for family meals or special occasions. The Sunday chicken dinner is a tradition in countless homes - a bird raised from chick, now fulfilling its purpose. Nothing goes to waste: meat for the pot, bones for broth, feathers for pillows, feet for stock, even the beak and claws for alchemy.

Not all chickens are domestic. In some regions, feral chickens descended from escaped birds scratch out livings in scrubland and forest edges. These half-wild populations intrigue hunters and trouble farmers - they're warier than domestic birds but still recognizable as chickens, creating an odd middle ground between wild game and livestock.
