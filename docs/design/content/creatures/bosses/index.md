Environmental control in boss territory:

**Common Lair Actions:**

- Summon minions
- Alter terrain
- Apply status effects

**Timing:** Usually on initiative count 20

**Purpose:** Make location matter, force tactical adaptation

**Phase Types:**

| Phase Change     | Trigger                   | Effect                   |
