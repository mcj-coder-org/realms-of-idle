# Ancient Dragon

## Lore

### Origin

Dragons are older than most civilizations, predating kingdoms and outliving empires. They are apex predators evolved to perfection - flight, breath weapon, immense strength, natural magic, and intelligence rivaling the wisest scholars. An ancient dragon has lived centuries or millennia, accumulating not just physical power but knowledge, cunning, and massive treasure hoards that drive their legendary greed.

The origin of dragons remains mysterious. Some scholars theorize they're natural evolution's ultimate expression, perfect predators developed over eons. Others suggest magical origin - perhaps created by ancient civilizations as guardians or weapons, or emerged from places where elemental magic concentrates. Dragons themselves offer contradictory accounts when willing to speak of such things, sometimes claiming descent from primordial beings, other times suggesting they simply... are, eternal as mountains.

What's certain: dragons are not mindless beasts but sapient beings with complex personalities, motivations, and individual goals. They range from beneficent guardians to tyrannical conquerors, from scholarly recluses to greedy hoarders. Each dragon is unique, shaped by centuries of experience into a distinct individual with opinions, grudges, allies, and elaborate schemes. This intelligence makes them far more dangerous than mere physical power suggests.

Ancient dragons specifically have lived long enough to become living legends. The youngest "ancient" dragon is typically 500+ years old, with the eldest approaching or exceeding 2000 years. At this age, dragons have witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, hoarded treasures worth kingdoms, and accumulated magical power that warps reality around them. They are effectively immortal unless killed, growing stronger indefinitely.

### In the World

An ancient dragon's presence shapes entire regions. Their territory, claimed through intimidation or force, spans hundreds of miles. Within this domain, the dragon rules absolutely - not through active governance but through overwhelming threat. Kingdoms negotiate with dragons as equals or superiors, paying tribute to avoid destruction. Villages exist at the dragon's sufferance, knowing any offense could bring fiery annihilation.

Not all dragons are actively hostile. Some prefer isolation, claiming remote mountains or deep forests where they can hoard treasures and study magic undisturbed. These reclusive dragons might not see humanoids for decades, and respond to trespassers based on mood and circumstance. Others integrate into society, offering protection in exchange for tribute, serving as advisors to kingdoms, or pursuing elaborate long-term goals incomprehensible to shorter-lived races.

Dragon hoards are legendary - vast caverns filled with gold, jewels, magical artifacts, and rare treasures accumulated over centuries. Dragons are compulsively driven to acquire and hoard wealth, though individual tastes vary. Some hoard traditional treasure. Others collect books, art, magical items, or even abstract things like secrets or promises. The hoard isn't just wealth but extension of the dragon's identity, and they guard it with paranoid fury.

Encountering an ancient dragon is life-defining experience. Their physical presence overwhelms - creatures the size of houses or larger, covered in scales harder than steel, radiating magical power and predatory menace. Their voice rumbles like thunder. Their eyes hold intelligence and memory stretching back centuries. Most who meet ancient dragons either become servants, allies, victims, or carefully retreat, recognizing when they're hopelessly outmatched.
