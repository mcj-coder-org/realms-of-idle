# Stone Sentinel

## Lore

### Origin

Stone Sentinels are not born but crafted - massive magical constructs created by ancient civilizations to guard places of power, treasure vaults, sacred temples, and forbidden knowledge. Each Sentinel represents months or years of skilled labor: master stonemasons carving the body, enchanters weaving protective magic, and ritualists binding guardian spirits to animate the whole. The result is an eternal watcher, capable of defending its charge for millennia.

The creation process varies by culture and era, but typically involves:

1. Selecting appropriate stone (usually granite, marble, or harder)
2. Carving humanoid form 10-20 feet tall
3. Inscribing runic protections across every surface
4. Binding elemental or guardian spirit to the stone
5. Programming specific commands and triggers
6. Consecrating through extended ritual

Once activated, Stone Sentinels serve indefinitely. They neither eat, sleep, nor age. They stand motionless for decades or centuries, appearing as mere statues until their programmed conditions trigger activation. Then they animate with crushing strength, magical resilience, and single-minded determination to fulfill their purpose. Most civilizations that created Sentinels have fallen, but their guardians remain, protecting ruins no one remembers.

The spirit bound within gives each Sentinel limited intelligence - more than mindless [Golems](index.md) but less than true sapience. They understand their purpose, can differentiate threats from non-threats (usually), and adapt tactics within their programming. Some ancient Sentinels develop something approaching awareness over millennia, though this is rare and unpredictable. These "awakened" Sentinels become far more dangerous, capable of genuine strategic thought.

Different Sentinel types exist based on creation culture and purpose. Temple Sentinels embody religious devotion, often incorporating holy symbols and blessed stone. Vault Sentinels focus purely on repelling thieves, armed with brutal efficiency. Tomb Sentinels protect the dead, sometimes harboring fragments of those they guard. Each type presents unique challenges based on its creators' expertise and paranoia.

### In the World

Stone Sentinels appear guarding ancient places:

**Common Locations:**

- Temple inner sanctums
- Treasure vaults
- Royal tombs
- Wizard towers
- Sacred groves
- Artifact repositories
- Forbidden archives

Most Sentinels have been active for centuries or millennia, surviving long after their creators perished. Adventurers, treasure seekers, and archaeologists regularly encounter them, usually unpleasantly. The Sentinel activates when some condition is met - stepping on pressure plates, opening sealed doors, attempting to take guarded objects, or simply entering its territory. Then 10-20 feet of magically-animated stone attacks with implacable determination.

Sentinels do not negotiate in conventional sense. They serve their programming absolutely. If commanded to "kill all intruders," they attack everyone. If commanded to "protect the sacred texts," they ignore those not threatening books. Understanding a Sentinel's specific programming is key to survival - sometimes you can avoid triggering them, or trigger them in ways they weren't designed to handle.

Some kingdoms and organizations discover intact Sentinels and attempt to reprogram or control them. This rarely works well - Sentinel magic resists alteration, and imperfectly reprogrammed guardians become unpredictable. But when successful, a repurposed Sentinel provides unparalleled security. Several royal vaults employ reclaimed Sentinels, and certain [Mage Guilds](../../systems/index.md) station them at important facilities.

### Weaknesses

Despite formidable defenses, Sentinels have exploitable weaknesses:

**Physical Vulnerabilities:**

- Joints (reduced armor at articulation points)
- Runic inscriptions (disrupting them weakens Sentinel)
- Core gem/heart (destroying it kills Sentinel)
- Weathering/cracks (older Sentinels have structural weaknesses)

**Magical Vulnerabilities:**

- [Force Magic](../../../systems/magic/index.md) bypasses physical defense
- [Sonic Attacks](../../../systems/magic/index.md) crack stone
- [Dispel Magic](../../../systems/magic/index.md) on runes weakens
- [Banishment](../../../systems/magic/index.md) forces bound spirit out
- Command word shutdown (if known)

**Tactical Weaknesses:**

- Slow movement (can be kited)
- Programmed behavior (predictable)
- Limited range (won't pursue beyond assigned area)
- Environmental hazards (can be trapped)

### Resources

**From Destroyed Sentinels:**

| Resource           | Yield        | Uses                                                                                          | Value        |
| ------------------ | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Carved Stone       | Tons         | [Building Materials](../../../systems/index.md), [Sculpture](../../../crafting/index.md)      | 5-20/ton     |
| Runic Plates       | 20-50 pieces | [Enchanting](../../../systems/index.md), [Magical Research](../../../systems/index.md)        | 50-200/piece |
| Core Gem           | 1 large gem  | [Enchanting](../../../systems/index.md) (legendary)                                           | 5000+        |
| Guardian Spirit    | Essence      | [Spirit Magic](../../../systems/magic/index.md), [Summoning](../../../systems/magic/index.md) | 1000-3000    |
| Ancient Mechanisms | Metal parts  | [Clockwork](../../../crafting/index.md), [Golems](index.md)                                   | Variable     |

**Ethical Considerations:**

- Some consider Sentinels enslaved spirits
- Destroying guards = looting what they protected
- Archaeological value vs. immediate threat
- Some Sentinels are culturally significant

### Fighting Stone Sentinels

**Preparation:**

| Preparation                                     | Benefit                           |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| [Force Weapons](../../../items/index.md)        | Bypass stone defense              |
| Sonic Attacks                                   | Crack and shatter stone           |
| High Mobility                                   | Exploit slow movement             |
| [Dispel Magic](../../../systems/magic/index.md) | Weaken runic protections          |
| Blunt Weapons                                   | More effective than blades        |
| Research                                        | Know command words or weak points |

**Tactics:**

- Hit and run (exploit slow speed)
- Target joints and runes
- Use environment (traps, hazards)
- Concentrate fire on weak points
- Divide party (some distract, some attack core)
- Know when you're in assigned territory (escape)

**Alternative Approaches:**

- Find command word (instant shutdown)
- Avoid triggering conditions
- Deactivate via ritual disruption
- Negotiate with awakened Sentinels
- Lure beyond territorial boundary
- Complete quest without triggering

### Bypassing Without Combat

Often possible with clever approach:

**Methods:**

| Method                      | Success Rate | Requirements                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Command Word                | 100%         | Must know word                                      |
| Avoid Trigger Conditions    | High         | Understand programming                              |
| Ritual Deactivation         | Moderate     | [Arcane Knowledge](../../../systems/index.md), time |
| Stealth                     | Moderate     | High [Stealth](../../../systems/index.md), luck     |
| False Identity              | Variable     | Convince you're allowed                             |
| Destroy Runes from Distance | High         | Ranged attacks, patience                            |

**Example Programming Logic:**

- "Attack anyone not wearing temple robes" → Wear robes
- "Protect the crown" → Don't touch crown
- "Guard until dawn" → Wait for sunrise
- "Kill all who speak" → Remain silent
- "Destroy unauthorized entry" → Present authorization

### Reprogramming Sentinels

Extremely difficult but possible:

**Requirements:**

- Master [Enchanting](../../../systems/index.md) skill
- [Ritual Magic](../../../systems/magic/index.md) knowledge
- Original design documentation (helpful)
- Weeks of careful work
- Significant magical resources

**Risks:**

- Sentinel activates during attempt
- Botched reprogramming creates unpredictable behavior
- Bound spirit resists or corrupts
- Ruins archaeological significance
- Violates original culture's sacred intent

**If Successful:**

- Loyal guardian for new purpose
- Extremely effective security
- Status symbol of power/knowledge
- Valuable for crucial facilities
