# Sprite

## Lore

### Origin

Sprites are the laughter of streams given form, the sparkle of sunlight on morning dew made manifest. Where nature celebrates itself, sprites appear - dancing on flower petals, playing in waterfalls, chasing fireflies through summer nights. They are not born in the way animals are born; they simply emerge when and where the world feels particularly alive, materializing from pure joy and wonder.

The oldest stories speak of sprites as fragments of the First Spring, when the world was young and everything new deserved celebration. Whether this is literally true or beautiful metaphor, no one can say. What's certain is that sprites have existed as long as flowers have bloomed and rivers have sung. They are as fundamental to nature as bees are to pollination, serving as both symptom and cause of ecological health.

Different environments spawn different sprite varieties. Forest sprites glow with soft green-gold light and tend to woodland creatures. Meadow sprites shimmer with flower colors and help pollination. Water sprites gleam like living gems and keep streams clear. Mountain sprites shine with crystalline brightness and sing to the stones. All share certain traits: diminutive size, flight, luminescence, and an irrepressible urge to play, help, and occasionally cause harmless mischief.

### In the World

Encounter a sprite and you've found a place nature considers special. They appear in healthy forests, pristine streams, ancient groves, and meadows bursting with wildflowers. Their presence indicates ecological balance - where sprites thrive, so does everything else. Conversely, their absence from places they once inhabited signals environmental decline.

Most people live their entire lives without seeing a sprite. These fey are notoriously shy around those who have "too much stone and smoke" about them - the metaphysical taint of excessive civilization. Children see sprites more often than adults, and those who live gently on the land catch glimpses at dawn or dusk. Druids, rangers, and certain mages can befriend sprites, earning their trust through consistent respect for nature.

Sprites have their own agendas, barely comprehensible to mortal minds. They might spend days decorating a single spider web with dewdrops arranged just so. They'll lead lost children to safety but ignore adults mere feet away. They steal shiny buttons but leave valuable coins untouched. They help gardens grow, warn animals of dangers, and punish those who harm their territories with harmless but frustrating pranks - tangled hair, misplaced tools, food that tastes like soap.

Some settlements maintain "sprite gardens" - wild areas deliberately left untended to attract and please these beings. A house with sprites is considered blessed, though they can be challenging neighbors. They appreciate offerings of honey, cream, and shiny trinkets. They despise iron, loud noises, and cruelty to small creatures. Respect these preferences and they might grant small blessings: crops that resist frost, wells that don't run dry, children who never get seriously lost in the woods.

### Resources

**From Sprites (ethical concerns):**

Sprites are sentient beings. Most cultures consider hunting them deeply wrong, akin to murder. However, sprites occasionally gift materials to trusted friends, and very rarely, sprite remains are found after natural death.

| Resource    | Obtained From   | Uses                                                                           | Rarity    |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| Sprite Dust | Gift or remains | [Alchemy](../../../crafting/index.md), [Enchanting](../../../systems/index.md) | Very Rare |
| Sprite Wing | Remains only    | [Alchemy](../../../crafting/index.md) (flight potions)                         | Legendary |
| Sprite Tear | Gift when moved | [Healing](../../../items/index.md) potions                                     | Very Rare |

**Ethical Considerations:**

- Killing sprites brings terrible luck and curses
- Other fey beings will know and seek revenge
- Most [Druids](../../classes/index.md) and [Rangers](../../classes/index.md) will consider it murder
- Sprites given voluntarily are 10x as potent as stolen ones
