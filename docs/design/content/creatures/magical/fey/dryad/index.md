# Dryad

## Lore

### Origin

Dryads are the oldest trees' consciousness given beautiful form, the forest's heart and memory made manifest. When an ancient tree - oak, ash, elm, or similar noble species - reaches sufficient age in a place suffused with natural magic, sometimes it awakens. Not merely becomes animate, but splits part of its awareness into a separate yet connected form: a dryad, simultaneously the tree and apart from it.

Theories abound about what triggers this awakening. Some scholars believe it requires centuries of growth plus exposure to ley lines or magical events. Druids suggest dryads emerge when a tree experiences strong emotion - perhaps love from tending forresters, grief over fallen companions, or joy in seasons of unusual abundance. The dryads themselves speak in riddles, metaphors, and poetry, making clear answers difficult.

What's certain: each dryad is inseparably bound to their tree. The dryad can venture some distance - usually a mile or so - but must periodically return. If the tree dies, the dryad perishes or fades into the forest's collective spirit, becoming something else entirely. If the dryad's manifested form is killed, the tree continues but never awakens again, its potential for consciousness forever lost. This dual existence shapes everything about dryad culture and psychology.

Different tree species produce different dryad personalities. Oak dryads tend toward strength and protection. Willow dryads favor flexibility and emotion. Elm dryads value community and interconnection. Ancient evergreens create dryads of patience and eternal memory. But individuals vary widely - a young, fiery oak dryad might differ drastically from an ancient, contemplative elder of the same species.

### In the World

To meet a dryad, venture deep into old-growth forests where humanity walks softly if at all. These are not the working woods where timber crews harvest - dryads inhabit primal groves, sacred forests, places protected by law, tradition, or simple inaccessibility. Some kingdoms designate "dryad groves" as protected lands, recognizing both the value of ancient forests and the danger of angering these powerful spirits.

Dryads serve as guardians, historians, and spiritual centers of their territories. Other fey defer to them. Animals seek their wisdom and protection. The forest itself seems to respond to their wishes - paths open or close, weather shifts, dangers emerge or retreat. A dryad's grove is simultaneously the safest and most dangerous place in any forest, depending entirely on the dryad's disposition toward visitors.

Most people never see dryads, only hear stories. Rangers occasionally earn their trust through years of respectful behavior. Druids may be tested and accepted as allies. [Wood Elves](../../races/index.md), living in harmony with forests for generations, maintain formal relationships with dryad communities. Others? The dryad reveals herself only if she chooses, appearing as a beautiful humanoid form seemingly made of living wood, bark, and leaves.

Dryads remember everything that occurs within their awareness. Some are thousands of years old, recalling kingdoms risen and fallen, heroes long forgotten, secrets buried beneath moss and time. This makes them invaluable sources of knowledge for historians and questers - if they can be convinced to share. Dryads rarely give answers freely, preferring tests, riddles, or requesting tasks that benefit their forest. They think in decades where mortals think in days.

### Resources

**Dryad Trees and Materials:**

Dryads are sentient beings. Harming or killing them is considered murder by most civilized cultures. Their trees are considered sacred. However, dryads occasionally gift wood or sap from their trees to worthy allies.

**Ethical Considerations:**

- Cutting a dryad's tree is murder and ecological disaster
- Other dryads will know and seek vengeance
- The forest itself turns hostile
- Kingdoms punish such crimes severely
- Gifts given freely are immensely powerful

**Benefits of Dryad Alliance:**

- Safe passage through dangerous forests
- Access to ancient knowledge and forgotten lore
- Powerful nature magic assistance in emergencies
- Gifts of magical wood, sap, or seeds
- Introduction to other fey beings
- Sanctuary in grove (one of safest places)
- Possible romantic relationship (very rare, extremely powerful)

**Requesting Aid:**

Dryads help those they trust, but usually require something in return:

- Plant endangered tree species elsewhere
- Stop logging operation threatening forest
- Retrieve stolen magical seed or artifact
- Solve mystery harming forest creatures
- Mediate conflict between settlement and wilderness

### Communication

Dryads speak multiple languages but prefer:

- Forest Common (dialect understood by all forest beings)
- Ancient Elvish
- The language of trees (incomprehensible to most)
- Riddles, poetry, and metaphor in any tongue

They struggle with:

- Direct questions (prefer indirect approach)
- Hurried conversations (they think slowly)
- Urban concepts (have little understanding of cities)
- Modern technology (confusing and distasteful)
