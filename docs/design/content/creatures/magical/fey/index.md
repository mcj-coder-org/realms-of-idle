# Fey Creatures

The fey are neither entirely spirit nor entirely flesh, existing in the liminal spaces where natural magic becomes conscious intention. They are nature's capricious children - beautiful, dangerous, incomprehensible, and utterly captivating. To encounter the fey is to step outside normal reality's rules and enter a realm where emotion, beauty, and chaos hold more weight than logic or law.

## Nature of the Fey

### Characteristics

All fey share certain fundamental traits:

**Magical Nature:**

- Innately magical, as natural as breathing
- Cannot be fully understood through mortal frameworks
- Operate by fey logic incomprehensible to most

**Timelessness:**

- Do not age in conventional sense
- Some are immortal unless killed
- Measure time differently than mortals

**Connection to Nature:**

- Embody natural forces and places
- Suffer when nature suffers
- Thrive where magic and wilderness meet

**Beauty and Terror:**

- Appear enchantingly beautiful to mortals
- Beauty often masks alien mindset
- Can shift between alluring and terrifying

**Iron Weakness:**

- [Iron](../../../items/index.md) disrupts their magic
- Causes pain, negates abilities
- Used in warding against fey
