# Pixie

## Lore

### Origin

Pixies embody chaos and whimsy given wings and will. Where sprites represent nature's joy, pixies represent its capriciousness - the sudden storm, the unexpected bloom, the twist of fate that changes everything. They are older than sprites, wilder, more dangerous, and infinitely more unpredictable. Some scholars theorize pixies predate organized nature itself, remnants of creation's chaotic first moments given permanent form.

Ancient legends describe pixies as children of the Laughing Moon, born when moonlight falls on mushroom circles during spring storms. Whether literally true or beautiful metaphor, pixies do seem most active during strange weather and lunar events. They gather in rings of mushrooms, dance in moonbeams, and celebrate chaos with infectious enthusiasm. To witness a pixie revel is to see reality become negotiable, rules become suggestions, and impossibility become merely unlikely.

Unlike sprites who serve nature's health or dryads who guard specific places, pixies serve only their own inscrutable whims. They might spend weeks arranging acorns in complex patterns, then destroy the work in a moment of boredom. They'll save a drowning child one day and lead a traveler hopelessly astray the next, not from malice but from pure chaotic impulse. They are not evil - evil requires intent and consistency - they simply operate by rules incomprehensible to more ordered minds.

Different pixie "courts" exist, though calling them organized would be generous. Summer pixies favor warmth and growth. Winter pixies embrace cold and change. Storm pixies delight in weather chaos. Shadow pixies prefer twilight and confusion. But these affiliations shift with pixie moods, which shift like weather patterns - constantly, drastically, without warning.

### In the World

Pixies appear wherever chaos and magic intersect: crossroads during storms, mushroom circles under full moons, places where ley lines tangle, ruins where ancient magic lingers. They're more common than dryads but less so than sprites, existing in that middle ground of "rare enough to be special, common enough that everyone knows someone who claims to have seen one."

Unlike sprites who hide from most people, pixies actively seek out mortals when the mood strikes. They might grant wishes or steal belongings, bestow blessings or inflict curses, offer prophetic advice or deliberate lies - sometimes all to the same person within the same conversation. The key to surviving pixie encounters is accepting you have no control. Attempting to bargain, threaten, or outwit them only invites escalation. Better to laugh, play along, and hope their attention moves elsewhere quickly.

Some villages maintain "pixie poles" - tall posts decorated with bells, ribbons, and shiny things, placed at settlement boundaries. The theory is pixies will become distracted playing with these offerings rather than pranking villagers. Effectiveness varies wildly. Sometimes pixies appreciate the gesture and bless crops. Sometimes they're insulted and make milk curdle. Sometimes they ignore the poles entirely and steal the mayor's trousers anyway. It depends on pixie mood, and pixie moods are unknowable.

Certain individuals develop reputations as "pixie-friends" - people pixies consistently return to. This is both blessing and curse. Pixie-friends gain access to powerful magic, secret knowledge, and fey protection. They also become targets for endless pranks, bizarre requests, and chaotic adventures. Most pixie-friends develop resigned amusement toward their situation, understanding resistance is futile and the perks occasionally outweigh the chaos.

### Resources

**Pixie Materials:**

Pixies are sentient beings. However, they're less offended by attempts to harvest materials than sprites or dryads, finding the attempts amusing. They're also terrible about leaving personal items scattered in random locations.

| Resource      | Obtained How            | Uses                                                                           | Rarity    |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| Pixie Dust    | Gift, theft, or remains | [Alchemy](../../../crafting/index.md) (illusions, flight)                      | Very Rare |

**Acquiring Pixie Materials:**

- Never attack pixies for materials (they escape or curse you)

- Make offerings at mushroom circles
- Complete pixie requests (expect absurd tasks)

**Pixie Bargains:**

Pixies make deals, but always with unexpected twists:

- "I wish to be rich" → Turned into King Richard temporarily
- "I wish to be beautiful" → Everyone else becomes ugly
- "I wish to fly" → Turned into a chicken
- "I wish to be powerful" → Given enormous muscles, can't move

The trick is asking for experiences rather than changes:

- "Show me something amazing" → Genuine wonder
- "Teach me a secret" → Actual useful knowledge
- "Play a game with me" → Fun and possible reward

**Befriending Pixies (kind of):**

You can't truly befriend pixies - they're too chaotic. But you can become their favorite entertainment:

- Never take them seriously
- Laugh at their pranks on you
- Play along with absurd requests
- Offer interesting items without expecting return
- Don't try to control or predict them
- Accept chaos as gift, not curse

Benefits:

- Occasional powerful magical help
- Protection from other fey threats
- Access to fey realm secrets
- Incredibly entertaining life
- Cursed in interesting ways instead of deadly ones

Drawbacks:

- Constant pranks
- Unexpected transformations
- Chaotic life trajectory
- Other people think you're crazy
- Property damage
