# Undead Creatures

The undead are neither fully alive nor peacefully dead, existing in the liminal state between. Whether animated corpses puppeted by [Necromancy](../../../systems/magic/index.md), or spirits unable to pass on, all undead represent tragedy - the violation of death's natural rest. They inspire horror not through alien monstrosity but through perversion of humanity's final peace, forcing confrontation with mortality's dark side.

## Nature of Undeath

### Core Characteristics

All undead share fundamental traits:

**Death Without Rest:**

- Once were living beings
- Died but did not stay dead
- Exist in unnatural state

**Negative Energy:**

- Sustained by death magic
- Harmed by [Holy Magic](../../../systems/magic/index.md)
- Healed by [Necromancy](../../../systems/magic/index.md)

**No Life Functions:**

- Don't breathe, eat, or sleep (though some pretend)
- Immune to biological needs
- Feel no conventional pain

**Supernatural Existence:**

- Violate natural laws
- Require magic to sustain
- Vulnerable to certain materials

## Creation and Origin

### Necromantic Creation

Most physical undead arise through deliberate [Necromancy](../../../systems/magic/index.md):

**Process:**

1. [Necromancer](../../classes/index.md) gathers corpse or bones
2. Casts animation spell
3. Binds negative energy to remains
4. Programs basic commands
5. Maintains control through magic

**Ethics:**

- Illegal in most civilizations
- Considered desecration of the dead
- Violates natural order
- Offends religious beliefs
- Risks creating uncontrolled undead

**Why Create Undead:**

- Tireless laborers
- Expendable warriors
- Research subjects
- Power demonstration
- Archaeological tools (controversial)

### Spontaneous Rising

Some undead arise without necromantic intervention:

**Cursed Ground:**

- Battlefields where thousands died
- Graveyards built on dark places
- Sites of terrible atrocities
- Locations cursed by powerful magic
- Spontaneously animate nearby dead

**Unfinished Business:**

- Strong emotion at death
- Overwhelming purpose left incomplete
- Refusal to accept mortality
- Oaths sworn binding beyond death
- Creates ghosts and revenants

**Disease and Plague:**

- Certain magical diseases cause rising
- Zombie plagues spread through bites
- Creates uncontrolled outbreaks
- Threatens entire regions
- Requires quarantine and cleansing

**Voluntary Transformation:**

- [Liches](index.md) choose undeath for immortality
- [Vampires](index.md) accept dark gift
- Death knights fall to corruption
- Always requires terrible price

## Undead and Society

### Legal Status

Most civilized lands treat undead as illegal abominations:

**Common Laws:**

- Creating undead: Execution or life imprisonment
- Possessing undead: Heavy fines, imprisonment
- Being undead: Destruction on sight (with exceptions)
- Researching necromancy: Monitoring, restriction
- Selling undead materials: Illegal in most regions

**Exceptions:**

- Academic research (licensed, supervised)
- [Clerics](../../classes/index.md) studying how to combat undead
- Certain cultures with ancestor worship traditions
- Isolated regions without enforcement

### Cultural Views

Different cultures respond differently:

**Rural Communities:**

- Deep fear and suspicion
- Stories of undead outbreaks
- Protective traditions (salt lines, [Holy Symbols](../../../items/index.md))
- Sometimes accommodate harmless ghosts
- Immediate calls for [Cleric](../../classes/index.md) help

**Urban Centers:**

- Some skepticism (never seen undead)
- Academic interest in phenomenon
- Resources for professional undead hunters
- Better organized response to outbreaks
- More nuanced legal frameworks

**Religious Institutions:**

- Nearly universal opposition
- Train specialists to combat undead
- Perform protective rituals
- Counsel those affected by undead
- Lead community responses to outbreaks

**Necromancers:**

- Small underground community
- Hidden laboratories and workshops
- Illegal gathering and sharing of knowledge
- Occasional legitimate researchers
- Hunted by authorities

### Economic Impact

**Undead Outbreaks Cost:**

- Quarantine of affected regions
- Military mobilization
- [Cleric](../../classes/index.md) hiring for mass [Turn Undead](../../../systems/magic/index.md)
- Lost productivity from deaths
- Property destruction
- Long-term regional abandonment

**Undead Materials Value:**

| Material             | Cost Range      | Legality | Uses                                              |
| -------------------- | --------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Bone Dust            | 5-20 copper     | Legal    | [Alchemy](../../../crafting/index.md), fertilizer |
| Ectoplasm            | 100-500 copper  | Legal    | [Spirit Magic](../../../systems/magic/index.md)   |
| Death Essence        | 200-1000 copper | Illegal  | [Necromancy](../../../systems/magic/index.md)     |
| Zombie Plague Sample | 500+ copper     | Illegal  | Research (dangerous)                              |

- Usually requires special circumstances

## Religious and Philosophical Perspectives

### Why Undeath is Wrong

Most religions and philosophers agree:

**Natural Order:**

- Death is natural cycle
- Undeath violates this cycle
- Disrupts balance of life/death
- Prevents soul's journey to afterlife

**Ethical Issues:**

- Desecration of the dead
- Violation of bodily autonomy
- Suffering for trapped spirits
- Creates dangerous conditions

**Practical Problems:**

- Spreads disease
- Causes terror and suffering
- Destabilizes communities
- Risks cascading outbreaks

### Minority Views

Some disagree:

**Academic Perspective:**

- Scientific interest in phenomenon
- Potential medical applications
- Study of consciousness and death
- Must balance ethics with knowledge

**Desperate Pragmatism:**

- Undead labor could benefit society
- Acceptable if properly controlled
- Lesser evil in certain situations
- Questionable slippery slope

**Cultural Variations:**

- Ancestor spirits viewed differently
- Some cultures accept protective ghosts
- Voluntary undeath for guardianship
- Context and consent matter
