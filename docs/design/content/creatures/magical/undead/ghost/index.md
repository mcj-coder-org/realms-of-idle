# Ghost

## Lore

### Origin

Unlike [Skeletons](skeleton/index.md) and [Zombies](zombie/index.md) which are animated corpses, ghosts are actual spirits - the consciousness of the deceased persisting after death without physical form. They arise not through [Necromancy](../../../systems/magic/index.md) but through tragedy: dying with overwhelming unfinished business, suffering violent unexpected death, being bound by curse or oath, or simply refusing to accept mortality. A ghost is a person who couldn't let go, trapped between life and the afterlife.

The psychology of ghosts is complex and tragic. Most don't realize they're dead, at least initially. They wake from death confused, trying to complete whatever they were doing when killed. A merchant ghost might attempt to finish a business deal. A mother ghost searches eternally for her lost child. A murdered ghost seeks justice or revenge. Some eventually accept their state and fade peacefully. Others become increasingly desperate, paranoid, and dangerous as years of failure drive them toward madness.

Not all ghosts are hostile. Many simply exist, replaying death moments endlessly without awareness. These "residual hauntings" are echoes rather than conscious spirits - supernatural recordings playing on loop. True intelligent ghosts range from helpful to malevolent depending on personality, death circumstances, and time elapsed since death. Fresh ghosts often retain their living personality. Ancient ghosts deteriorate, obsession consuming everything else until only single-minded purpose remains.

Different ghost types exist based on death circumstance and emotional state. [Wraiths](index.md) arise from violent hateful deaths, becoming pure malice. [Specters](index.md) result from betrayal and injustice. [Poltergeists](index.md) are teenager deaths - confused, angry, lashing out chaotically. [Banshees](index.md) emerge from women who died protecting loved ones, their wails warning of impending death. Each ghost type represents different aspects of death's trauma.

### In the World

Ghosts haunt places significant to their lives or deaths: family homes, murder sites, beloved gardens, battlefields, theaters where they performed, taverns they frequented. Unlike physical undead requiring bodies, ghosts manifest wherever they feel strongest connection. Some remain visible constantly. Others appear only at specific times - anniversary of death, midnight, full moon - following patterns meaningful to them.

Encountering ghosts evokes complex emotions beyond simple fear. These were people, often local people whose stories are known. Grandmother's ghost still rocking in her favorite chair. The blacksmith who died defending the village. The young lovers who drowned together. Communities often know their ghosts by name, history, and habits. "Don't go to the mill at midnight - Old Henrik walks then, and he gets upset if disturbed."

Some settlements accommodate their ghosts. A seat stays empty for the ghost who sits there. Offerings left for protective spirits. Annual remembrance ceremonies to soothe restless dead. Other communities demand [Clerics](../../classes/index.md) perform exorcisms, viewing any lingering dead as unnatural abomination. Both approaches have merit - some ghosts genuinely need help passing on, while others serve as benevolent guardians.

Ghost encounters aren't always supernatural horror. Sometimes they're deeply sad: meeting someone's grandfather who doesn't realize he died twenty years ago, still waiting for family to visit. Or profound: a ancient ghost sharing wisdom accumulated over centuries of observation. Or oddly mundane: a ghost annoyed that new homeowners rearranged furniture. Ghosts retain their personality, making each encounter unique based on who they were in life and how death changed them.

### Unfinished Business

**Common Motivations:**

| Business Type   | Ghost Behavior            | Resolution                |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Protect Family  | Guards descendants        | Family safe               |
| Seek Justice    | Reveals murder clues      | Killer brought to justice |
| Find Lost Item  | Searches endlessly        | Item found/returned       |
| Deliver Message | Attempts communication    | Message delivered         |
| Protect Place   | Guards location           | Place remains safe        |
| Finish Work     | Continues life task       | Work completed            |
| Await Someone   | Waits for specific person | Person comes/released     |
| Revenge         | Hunts those responsible   | Justice or forgiveness    |

**Helping Ghosts Pass On:**

Resolving unfinished business allows ghosts to finally rest:

| Action                   | Effect       | Notes                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Complete their task      | +20 progress | Most direct solution     |
| Deliver their message    | +15 progress | Communication was goal   |
| Bring justice for murder | +25 progress | Major resolution         |
| Reunite with loved one   | +20 progress | Emotional closure        |
| Protect what they valued | +10 progress | Shows respect for wishes |
| Remember them properly   | +5 progress  | Acknowledgment matters   |
| Perform burial rites     | +10 progress | Ritual significance      |

At 100% progress, ghost can choose to pass on peacefully.

### Resources

**Ghost Materials:**

Ghosts are incorporeal, leaving no physical remains. However, they're connected to certain items:

| Resource       | Connection          | Uses                                                                                   | Rarity    |
| -------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Ectoplasm      | Ghost manifestation | [Alchemy](../../../crafting/index.md), [Spirit Magic](../../../systems/magic/index.md) | Very Rare |
| Spirit Essence | Willing gift        | [Enchanting](../../../systems/index.md), [Necromancy](../../../systems/magic/index.md) | Legendary |
| Haunted Object | Ghost's anchor      | Contains fragment of ghost                                                             | Rare      |
| Ghost Tears    | Extreme sorrow      | [Healing](../../../items/index.md), [Alchemy](../../../crafting/index.md)              | Very Rare |

**Ethical Considerations:**

- Forcing ghosts to manifest drains them
- Destroying ghosts without resolving business is cruel
- Trapping ghosts in objects is torture
- Most ghosts just want help and peace
- [Clerics](../../classes/index.md) can guide them to afterlife respectfully

### Communication with Ghosts

**Methods:**

| Method                                             | Success Rate | Requirements                           |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| [Speak with Dead](../../../systems/magic/index.md) | High         | [Cleric](../../classes/index.md) spell |
| [Spirit Board](../../../items/index.md)            | Moderate     | Focus, patience                        |
| [Medium](../../classes/index.md)                   | High         | Specialized individual                 |
| Waiting for manifestation                          | Variable     | Ghost must want contact                |

**Ghost Communication Traits:**

- Speak languages they knew in life
- Sometimes speak in riddles or fragments
- May not realize they're dead initially
- Ancient ghosts' language may have changed
- Emotional, not always rational
- May lie if personality was dishonest

### Destroying vs. Helping Ghosts

**Destruction Methods (last resort):**

| Method                                          | Effectiveness | Consequences                    |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| [Smite Undead](../../../systems/magic/index.md) | High          | Ghost destroyed, no peace       |
| [Exorcism](../../../systems/magic/index.md)     | High          | Forced to afterlife (traumatic) |
| [Holy Water](../../../items/index.md)           | Moderate      | Painful for ghost               |
| [Silver Weapons](../../../items/index.md)       | Moderate      | Can harm incorporeal            |
| Destroy anchor object                           | High          | Releases or destroys ghost      |

**Helping Methods (preferred):**

| Method                      | Effectiveness | Outcome                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- |
| Resolve unfinished business | Very High     | Ghost passes on peacefully |
| Deliver messages            | High          | Closure achieved           |
| Bring justice               | Very High     | Purpose fulfilled          |
| Perform rites               | Moderate      | Ritual comfort             |
| Reunite with loved one      | Very High     | Emotional resolution       |
| Promise to remember         | Moderate      | Acknowledgment of life     |

Most [Clerics](../../classes/index.md) and good-aligned adventurers prefer helping ghosts pass on rather than destroying them. Destruction denies them afterlife peace and is considered unnecessarily cruel unless ghost is actively malevolent.
