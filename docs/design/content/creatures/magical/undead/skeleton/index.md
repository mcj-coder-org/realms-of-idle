# Skeleton

## Lore

### Origin

Skeletons are not spontaneous phenomena but deliberate creations - or tragedies. Most arise through [Necromancy](../../../systems/magic/index.md), animated by mages who disregard the sacred rest of the dead. A few manifest through darker means: cursed battlefields where the dying swore oaths of eternal vengeance, ancient burial grounds disturbed by grave robbers, or places so steeped in death magic that corpses refuse to stay buried.

The ethical horror of skeleton creation cannot be overstated. These were people - farmers, soldiers, parents, children - who deserved peaceful rest. Instead, their bones are puppeted like grotesque marionettes, serving purposes they would have found abhorrent in life. Most necromancers justify their art with claims that bones are "just matter," empty vessels devoid of the departed soul. Whether this is true or self-serving rationalization remains debated among [Clerics](../../classes/index.md) and philosophers.

What makes skeletons particularly unsettling is their silence. They don't moan like [Zombies](zombie/index.md), don't wail like [Ghosts](ghost/index.md). They simply exist, clicking and clattering, empty eye sockets somehow conveying an impression of looking without seeing, following commands without comprehension. Some observers report feeling watched by skeletons, sensing residual awareness behind the animated bones. Others dismiss this as projection. Either way, encountering skeletons produces profound unease in most people.

Different skeleton types exist based on source material. Human skeletons are most common, created from readily available remains. Animal skeletons occasionally serve [Necromancers](../../classes/index.md), particularly predators like wolves or bears, becoming bonded servants more dangerous than their human counterparts. Ancient battlefields might spawn armored skeleton warriors still wearing remnants of their military gear, muscle memory guiding sword arms long after flesh has rotted away.

### In the World

Skeletons appear wherever necromancy is practiced or death magic accumulates: wizard towers of ethically questionable mages, ancient battlefields, cursed graveyards, forgotten crypts, and ruins of civilizations that dabbled in dark arts. Their presence invariably indicates something wrong - either active necromancy or residual death magic strong enough to spontaneously animate the dead.

Most kingdoms strictly prohibit necromantic animation. Creating skeletons is illegal, using them is illegal, and being caught with skeleton servants typically means execution. Not all nations enforce these laws equally - some corrupt officials accept bribes to look away, certain researchers claim academic exemption, and isolated regions simply lack enforcement capability. But societal taboo remains strong: decent people don't create undead, period.

Despite prohibition, skeletons persist. Rogue necromancers in hidden laboratories animate the dead for forbidden experiments. Ancient crypts disturbed by treasure seekers unleash guardian skeletons that have maintained patrol routes for centuries. Cursed battlefields spontaneously spawn skeleton warriors each anniversary of the conflict. Occasionally, a skeleton escapes its creator's control and wanders aimlessly, following its last command indefinitely or until destroyed.

Encountering skeletons means danger, but not always combat. Some serve as mindless guardians, attacking only those who enter forbidden zones. Others follow specific commands ("kill all intruders," "protect this chamber," "dig up artifacts") without deviation. Rarely, a skeleton with fragments of former personality might be reasoned with, though this typically indicates transitioning into something worse - a [Revenant](index.md) or worse. Most adventurers treat skeletons as kill-on-sight threats, both from danger and desire to grant the desecrated dead their deserved rest.

**Ethical Considerations:**

- Bones are remains of real people
- Many cultures require proper burial afterward
- [Clerics](../../classes/index.md) may insist on consecration rituals
- Using undead materials is taboo in many societies
- Some [Necromancers](../../classes/index.md) will track their "property"

### Creating Skeletons (Necromancy)

**Requirements for Animation:**

| Component                                            | Purpose            | Availability |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| Corpse/Bones                                         | Physical vessel    | Common       |
| [Necromantic Spell](../../../systems/magic/index.md) | Animation magic    | Restricted   |
| Death Essence                                        | Fuel for animation | Rare         |
| Command Word                                         | Control mechanism  | Created      |
| Focus Item                                           | Channel control    | Variable     |

**Limitations:**

- Requires [Necromancy](../../../systems/magic/index.md) skill
- Illegal in most jurisdictions
- Requires ongoing magic to maintain (or permanent binding)
- Limited intelligence (cannot improvise or problem-solve)
- Range-limited control (lose control if too far)
- Societal taboo and ethical implications

**Why Necromancers Create Skeletons:**

- Tireless laborers for menial tasks
- Expendable guards and warriors
- Research subjects for death magic
- Power demonstration
- Archaeological excavation
- Army creation (illegal warfare)

### Destroying Skeletons

**Effective Methods:**

| Method                                        | Effectiveness | Notes                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Blunt Weapons                                 | Excellent     | Shatter bones efficiently                                                                       |

| Fire                                          | Good          | Destroys bones completely                                                                       |
| Slashing Weapons                              | Poor          | Pass through gaps between bones                                                                 |
| Piercing Weapons                              | Poor          | Arrows ineffective on bones                                                                     |
| [Holy Water](../../../items/index.md)         | Good          | Burns undead on contact                                                                         |

**Non-Combat Solutions:**

- [Turn Undead](../../../systems/magic/index.md) (Clerics): Repel or destroy
- Disrupt necromantic control: Break focus item
- [Consecrate Ground](../../../systems/magic/index.md): Prevents animation in area
- Proper burial: Lay bones to rest with rituals
- Dispel magic: Removes animation enchantment
