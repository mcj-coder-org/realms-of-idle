# Zombie

## Lore

### Origin

Zombies represent necromancy's most visceral horror - not clean bones but rotting flesh, lurching corpses still bearing the faces they wore in life. Created through [Necromancy](../../../systems/magic/index.md) similar to [Skeletons](skeleton/index.md), zombies use more recently deceased bodies, animated before decomposition reduces them to bones. This makes them both more disturbing and, paradoxically, more durable than their skeletal counterparts.

The desecration inherent in zombie creation multiplies the ethical horror of skeleton animation. These were people who died recently, perhaps still mourned by loved ones. Their features remain recognizable - a farmer's weathered hands, a merchant's distinctive nose, a soldier's battle scars. Worse, some viewers report seeing recognition in zombie eyes, suggesting fragments of consciousness trapped within animated flesh. Whether this is true or psychological projection remains debated, but encountering a zombified friend or relative ranks among adventuring's worst experiences.

Zombies arise through several means. Most commonly, [Necromancers](../../classes/index.md) deliberately animate fresh corpses for servitude. Occasionally, plague or curse creates spontaneous zombification - entire villages of dead rising without necromantic intervention, driven by disease magic rather than deliberate spellwork. Rarest and worst, some zombies arise from individuals who died with overwhelming unfinished business, their desperate will to continue animating their cooling corpse. These self-willed zombies are most dangerous, driven by obsession rather than command.

Different zombie types emerge based on preservation state and animation method. Fresh zombies retain significant strength and agility. Rotted zombies move slower but resist damage better, decay creating insulating layers. Plague zombies spread disease through bite and touch. Drowned zombies waterlogged and bloated, emerge from lakes and swamps. Each variant presents unique challenges beyond their fundamental wrongness.

### In the World

Zombies appear in similar locations to skeletons - necromancer lairs, cursed sites, ancient battlefields - but also wherever disease or plague magic takes hold. A [Necromancer](../../classes/index.md) might maintain zombie laborers for heavy work, their enhanced strength valuable for mining or construction. Cursed villages where everyone died simultaneously might spawn shambling dead that attack the living mindlessly. Swamps and marshes preserve corpses unusually well, becoming zombie breeding grounds when death magic seeps into stagnant water.

Like skeleton creation, zombie animation is illegal across most civilized lands. The taboo runs deeper, though - skeletons are at least distant from life, clean bones rather than rotting meat. Zombies force confrontation with mortality's grotesque reality. Even hardened [Necromancers](../../classes/index.md) preferring skeletons for aesthetic reasons describe zombie animation as "unpleasant but occasionally necessary."

Zombie encounters are more dangerous than skeleton fights for several reasons. Zombies don't simply hit hard - they spread disease, they grab and bite, and destroying them releases foul contamination that can sicken the unprepared. They're also more resilient than skeletons, lacking convenient gaps between bones that weapons might slip through. A sword that passes harmlessly between skeleton ribs must physically hack through zombie flesh, exhausting combatants.

Public response to zombie outbreaks verges on panic. Kingdoms mobilize military forces, [Clerics](../../classes/index.md) organize purging rituals, and entire regions are quarantined. Not merely from combat danger - zombie plagues can spread, turning victims into new zombies, creating cascading outbreaks that threaten civilization. Historical zombie plagues that nearly ended kingdoms ensure modern governments take undead threats seriously.

### Creating Zombies (Necromancy)

**Requirements for Animation:**

| Component                                            | Purpose            | Availability |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| Fresh Corpse                                         | Physical vessel    | Common       |
| [Necromantic Spell](../../../systems/magic/index.md) | Animation magic    | Restricted   |
| Death Essence                                        | Fuel for animation | Rare         |
| Preservation Agent                                   | Slow decay         | Optional     |
| Command Word                                         | Control mechanism  | Created      |

**Why Zombies Over Skeletons:**

- Superior strength for heavy labor
- More durable in combat
- Better at grappling and restraining
- Intimidation factor (psychological warfare)
- Can be created faster (no need to clean bones)

**Why Skeletons Over Zombies:**

- Don't spread disease
- Less disgusting to maintain
- Don't require preservation efforts
- Lighter (easier transport)
- Less obvious if partially hidden (bones blend with ruins)

### Destroying Zombies

**Effective Methods:**

| Method                                        | Effectiveness | Notes                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fire                                          | Excellent     | Destroys flesh, prevents disease                                                                |
| [Holy Magic](../../../systems/magic/index.md) | Excellent     | [Smite Undead](../../../systems/magic/index.md), [Turn Undead](../../../systems/magic/index.md) |
| Decapitation                                  | Excellent     | Severs necromantic control                                                                      |
| Blunt Weapons                                 | Good          | Crush bones and tissue                                                                          |
| Slashing Weapons                              | Moderate      | Must hack repeatedly                                                                            |
| [Holy Water](../../../items/index.md)         | Good          | Burns undead flesh                                                                              |

**Non-Combat Solutions:**

- [Turn Undead](../../../systems/magic/index.md) (Clerics): Repel or destroy
- Disrupt necromantic control: Kill necromancer
- [Consecrate Ground](../../../systems/magic/index.md): Prevents animation
- Quarantine: Contain until they decompose fully
- Mass burning: Cleanse outbreak areas

### Zombie Hordes

**Horde Mechanics:**

Small groups (3-5 zombies) are manageable. Hordes (10+) become exponentially more dangerous:

| Horde Size | Danger Level | Special Abilities               |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| 3-5        | Moderate     | Basic threat                    |
| 6-10       | High         | Can surround individuals        |
| 11-20      | Very High    | Overwhelm even skilled fighters |
| 21-50      | Extreme      | Crush through barricades        |
| 50+        | Catastrophic | Threaten entire settlements     |

**Horde Tactics:**

- Surround and grab
- Press forward mindlessly
- Absorb casualties without morale loss
- Spread disease rapidly
- Create noise attracting more zombies
- Exhaust defenders over time

**Countering Hordes:**

- Chokepoints (force single file)
- Fire (spread through packed groups)
- [Turn Undead](../../../systems/magic/index.md) (mass repulsion)
- Elevated positions (prevent grappling)
- Strategic retreat (don't get surrounded)
- Kill necromancer (drops all zombies)
