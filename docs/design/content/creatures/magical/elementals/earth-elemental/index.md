# Earth Elemental

## Lore

### Origin

Earth elementals rise where the bones of the world lie close to the surface - in deep caverns where crystal formations sing with power, at the hearts of mountains where pressure and magic merge, in quarries where thousands of years of accumulated stone dust has absorbed enough ambient magic to achieve consciousness. They are the patient will of stone and soil given form, the slow certainty of mountains compressed into being.

To behold an earth elemental is to witness geology animated. They appear as moving masses of rock, soil, and crystal, their forms suggesting humanoid shapes but remaining fundamentally alien. Some glitter with gemstone inclusions, others bear patterns of sedimentary layers like the rings of ancient trees. They move with surprising grace despite their massive forms, each step deliberate and considered as if remembering the weight of mountains.

Dwarven stonecutters speak of earth elementals with profound respect tinged with ancient wariness. Their eldest tales tell of the Days of Digging, when their ancestors first delved deep and encountered "the Slow Ones" - earth elementals that had dwelt in darkness since the world's birth. The treaties made then still hold: disturb no place where crystals sing, take no more stone than you give back in craft, and honor the deep silences.

### In the World

Unlike fire or water elementals, which manifest relatively frequently, earth elementals are creatures of geological time scales. One might slumber for centuries before stirring, awakened by earthquake, volcanic eruption, or the culmination of slow magical processes invisible to mortal perception. When they do manifest, their presence reshapes the landscape - stone flows like water, caves open and close, and the very ground becomes uncertain.

Miners learn to recognize the warning signs of an earth elemental's awakening: stones that hum with subsonic vibrations, pickaxes that strike stone and ring like struck bells, dust that swirls in patterns defying natural currents. Wise foremen call immediate evacuation when these signs appear. The greedy or ignorant who ignore them are rarely heard from again - not killed, usually, but lost in suddenly-shifted tunnels, walking passages that no longer connect to the surface.

Not all encounters spell doom. Villages built on particularly old bedrock sometimes report protective earth elementals, beings that have claimed the settlement as part of their territory. These guardians reinforce foundations during earthquakes, cause rockslides to block invading armies, and slowly shift stone to create natural fortifications. They ask nothing in return except that the inhabitants treat the land with respect - no deep wells that might weaken the foundation, no quarrying of bedrock, no blasting with explosives.

Artificers and enchanters prize earth elemental essence above almost all other materials. Weapons forged with it never dull or break, armor reinforced with it turns aside blows that would shatter ordinary steel, and buildings constructed with elemental-touched stone stand for millennia. The challenge lies in gathering such essence - earth elementals dissipate slowly, their forms gradually losing coherence over hours or even days, giving ample time for harvest but requiring the harvester to remain near a potentially dangerous elemental remnant.
