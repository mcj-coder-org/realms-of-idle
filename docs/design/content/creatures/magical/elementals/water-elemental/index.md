# Water Elemental

## Lore

### Origin

Water elementals manifest where the currents between worlds run deep - at the hearts of ancient wells, in sacred springs blessed by forgotten gods, at the meeting of three rivers, or in ocean depths where pressure and magic converge. They are water given will, currents shaped into consciousness, the essence of flow and change made manifest.

Unlike their fiery cousins, water elementals rarely maintain a fixed form for long. They ripple and shift, sometimes appearing as vaguely humanoid columns of crystal-clear water, other times as swirling vortices or gentle waves given depth and dimension. Some shimmer with an inner light like sunlight through ocean waves, while others are dark as deep water, their depths mysterious and unknowable.

The old river folk say that water elementals remember - they carry echoes of every stream they've touched, every raindrop they've absorbed, every shore they've caressed. Whether this is literal truth or poetic fancy, water elementals do seem to possess a strange continuity of experience, as if each is somehow connected to all water everywhere, if only faintly.

### In the World

Coastal villages and riverside communities develop complex relationships with water elementals. Some are beloved guardians, filling fishing nets when they're empty and warming bathwater on cold nights. Others are troublesome neighbors, flooding cellars during disagreements or pulling pranks that leave farmers' fields waterlogged at inconvenient times.

The River Watch, a loose association of water mages and elementalists, maintains records of known water elementals and their behaviors. They caution that while water elementals are generally more amiable than fire elementals and less alien than air elementals, they think in terms of currents and tides, erosion and flow. What seems like playful mischief to an elemental - redirecting a stream, causing heavy rain - can devastate human infrastructure.

Sailors tell tales of water elementals rising from the sea to observe ships, their forms towering above the waves. Most such encounters end peacefully, with the elemental simply watching for a time before sinking back into the depths. The unlucky few who've angered these ocean spirits speak of waves that target specific vessels, of water that seems to reach up and grasp, of drowning in air thick with elemental rage.

Those who work with water elementals professionally - mages, alchemists, artificers - find them more communicative than other elemental types. Through carefully crafted spells, experienced practitioners can establish genuine dialogue, though the elemental's perspective remains decidedly inhuman. They speak of "the great flow" and "the return to source," concepts that defy easy translation but seem to represent some fundamental philosophy of existence.
