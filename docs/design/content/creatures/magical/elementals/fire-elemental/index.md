# Fire Elemental

## Lore

### Origin

Fire elementals are not born in the conventional sense - they manifest where the boundary between the material world and the Elemental Plane of Fire grows thin. Volcanic vents, ancient forge-hearts, places where catastrophic fires once raged, or sites of powerful fire magic can all become doorways through which these beings slip into the mortal realm.

To witness a fire elemental is to see flame given consciousness and purpose. They are not creatures wearing fire like a cloak; they ARE fire, shaped by will and magical law into something approaching a living being. Most appear as roughly humanoid columns of dancing flame, though their form is fluid and ever-changing. Some scholars theorize that the humanoid shape reflects some deep magical principle, while others suggest elementals simply mimic the forms they see most often.

Unlike common fire, which consumes mindlessly, fire elementals display what can only be called personality. Some are playful, dancing through the air and delighting in the warmth they provide. Others burn with fierce purpose, their movements sharp and aggressive. The wisest mages caution against assuming all fire elementals think alike - each is as individual as the flames that birthed it, and treating them as identical leads to dangerous misunderstandings.

### In the World

In regions where elemental activity is common, people learn to recognize the signs of an elemental manifestation. An unusually persistent flame that moves against the wind, a fire that burns without consuming its fuel, or flames that seem to watch and react to movement - these indicate an elemental presence rather than ordinary combustion.

Blacksmiths in the Dragon's Spine mountains sometimes report friendly fire elementals appearing in their forges, drawn by the concentrated heat and the rhythmic work. These workshop spirits, as locals call them, seem to enjoy the process of creation, burning hotter when the smith is working and dimming when they rest. Wise smiths leave offerings of coal or wood as thanks, though the elementals seem to care more for the gesture than the fuel itself.

Not all encounters are benign. Fire elementals summoned by inexperienced mages, or those manifesting in places of great anger or destruction, can be dangerously volatile. They spread flames not from malice but from their very nature - asking a fire elemental not to burn is like asking water not to be wet. The key to safe interaction lies in understanding that fire elementals are not evil, merely elemental. They mean no harm; harm is simply what they are.

Alchemists and enchanters prize components harvested from dissipated fire elementals. The crystallized essence left behind when an elemental loses its hold on the material plane contains raw elemental energy in its purest form. A single shard can fuel forges for weeks, power enchantments of incredible potency, or serve as the heart of magical items attuned to heat and flame.
