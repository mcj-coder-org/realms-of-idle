# Air Elemental

## Lore

### Origin

Air elementals manifest where wind and magic intertwine - at storm-lashed mountain peaks, in the eye of hurricanes, within tornado funnels, or at the convergence of conflicting weather systems. They are breath given will, currents shaped into consciousness, the essence of movement and freedom compressed into something approaching physical form. To encounter an air elemental is to witness emptiness that somehow has substance, invisibility that occupies space.

Most observers struggle to perceive air elementals clearly. They appear as distortions in the atmosphere, like heat shimmer or the ripple of wind through wheat fields. Some manifest as swirling vortices of dust and leaves, others as impossibly fast-moving patches of clear air that bend light strangely. The truly powerful ones take on almost human outlines, their edges defined by streaming clouds and barely-visible currents. One thing remains constant: they never stop moving. An air elemental at rest is a contradiction - they ARE movement itself.

The oldest weather-witches claim air elementals are actually visitors from multiple parallel moments, existing simultaneously in past, present, and slightly-future time. This would explain their seeming prescience, their ability to be in multiple places at once, and their complete disregard for conventional ideas of cause and effect. Whether true or simply the confused observations of those who've spent too long staring into storms, the theory persists.

### In the World

Sailors fear and revere air elementals in equal measure. A helpful wind elemental can fill sails when the sea lies flat and calm, or redirect dangerous squalls away from vulnerable vessels. An angry one can capsize galleons, scatter entire fleets, or create localized storms that pursue specific ships for days. The trick, old captains say, lies in never trying to control an air elemental - you can only suggest, plead, or offer, and even then success is far from guaranteed.

Mountain peoples tell of wind shepherds - air elementals that have claimed specific peaks or valleys as territory. These beings guide lost travelers by creating subtle pressure differences that feel like gentle pushes in the right direction. They warn of avalanches by howling in particular patterns, or of approaching storms through changes in air pressure that make ears pop. Villages in wind shepherd territory maintain tradition of leaving prayer flags and wind chimes as offerings, though whether the elementals appreciate these or even notice them remains unclear.

Unlike other elementals, air elementals rarely seem interested in mortal affairs. They're far more concerned with currents, pressure systems, and the complex dance of weather patterns across the globe. Attempting to summon one is often likened to trying to catch the wind in a net - technically possible with the right magic, but the wind rarely stays caught for long, and resents the attempt.

Alchemists and enchanters who work with air elemental essence describe it as the most difficult to stabilize. Fire essence stays contained, water essence remains liquid, earth essence solidifies reliably - but air essence wants to escape, to dissipate, to rejoin the greater atmosphere. Bottles containing it must be sealed with specific magics or the essence simply... leaves. This escaped essence is harmless but renders the expensive collection effort worthless, adding to the frustration of working with these most elusive elementals.
