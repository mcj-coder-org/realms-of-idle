# Elementals

Living manifestations of the four classical elements, elementals are beings of pure elemental energy given form and consciousness. Unlike natural creatures that evolved over time, elementals exist as fragments of the elemental planes themselves - raw forces shaped by magical law into something approaching life.

## The Four Elements

| Element                     | Level | Behavior            | Primary Trait     |
| --------------------------- | ----- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| [Fire](fire-elemental.md)   | 10-15 | Indifferent-Hostile | Consuming passion |
| [Water](water-elemental.md) | 10-15 | Defensive-Neutral   | Adaptive flow     |
| [Earth](earth-elemental.md) | 12-17 | Passive-Aggressive  | Patient endurance |
| [Air](air-elemental.md)     | 11-16 | Indifferent-Playful | Restless freedom  |

## Elemental Nature

### What Makes Them Elemental

**Not Natural Creatures:**

- Don't reproduce biologically
- Don't age or die naturally
- Don't require food (absorb elemental energy)
- Return to elemental plane when defeated
- Partially exist outside normal reality

**Magical Beings:**

- Manifest where planes intersect
- Composed entirely of elemental matter
- Think in alien, elemental patterns
- Immune to mortal concerns (fear, greed, ambition)
- Can be summoned by appropriate magic

### Elemental Planes

Elementals originate from their respective planes of existence:

| Plane          | Nature                          | Denizens         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Plane of Fire  | Eternal combustion, no fuel     | Fire elementals  |
| Plane of Water | Infinite ocean, crushing depths | Water elementals |
| Plane of Earth | Solid matter, no empty space    | Earth elementals |
| Plane of Air   | Empty sky, eternal winds        | Air elementals   |

These planes occasionally touch the material world, allowing elementals to slip through.
