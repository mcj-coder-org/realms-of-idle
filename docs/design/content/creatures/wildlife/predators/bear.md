# Bear

## Lore

### Origin

Bears are living mountains of fur and muscle, apex predators that command respect from every creature in the forest. These solitary giants have roamed the wilderness since the world was young, outlasting kingdoms and outliving legends. The dwarves of the Iron Mountains claim that bears were carved from stone by the Earth Mother herself, given life to guard the deep places of the world.

Stories of bears fill every culture's folklore. Some paint them as wise protectors of the forest, others as fearsome demons of the wild. The truth, as rangers know, lies between: bears are neither benevolent nor malicious, but powerful survivors with little patience for threats to themselves or their cubs. A mother bear defending her young is perhaps the most dangerous force in nature - more than one legendary warrior has met their end underestimating a bear's protective fury.

### In the World

Seeing a bear in the wild inspires equal parts awe and terror. These magnificent creatures can stand over eight feet tall on their hind legs, their roars echoing through valleys, their presence commanding instant attention from every living thing nearby. Experienced wilderness travelers know to make noise while hiking, giving bears advance warning to avoid surprise encounters - most bears would rather leave humans alone.

The annual salmon runs draw bears to rivers in impressive numbers, and wise fishermen know to yield their favorite spots when the great beasts arrive. Watching a bear fish is a study in patient power: standing in the current, still as stone, then exploding into motion with incredible speed to snatch silvery prey from the water. These gatherings are among the few times bears tolerate each other's presence, though disputes over prime fishing spots can turn violent.

Bear meat, when properly prepared, feeds families for weeks. The rich, dark flesh benefits from slow cooking, rendering down the fat into valuable tallow. Bear pelts are treasured as the warmest blankets and cloaks money can buy - a properly tanned bear hide can mean the difference between life and death in a harsh mountain winter. Hunters who bring down a bear are celebrated in song and story, their courage and skill proving them worthy of respect.

Alchemists prize bear components above almost all others. Bear bile aids digestion and clarity of thought. Bear claws ground into powder strengthen potions of vitality. Most valuable are the bear's gall bladder and heart, rare reagents commanding enough gold to feed a village for a season. This high value has led to tragedy: greedy hunters pursuing bears in protected forests, leading to retaliatory enforcement by both rangers and, some swear, the bears themselves.
