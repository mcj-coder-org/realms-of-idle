# Mountain Lion

## Lore

### Origin

Mountain lions are ghosts made flesh - tawny phantoms that haunt rocky crags and forest shadows, seen only when they wish to be seen. These solitary hunters have mastered the art of the ambush, their patience legendary among rangers and trappers. An old wilderness saying claims "you've been watched by a hundred mountain lions you never saw." While perhaps exaggerated, the sentiment holds truth: these cats observe far more than they engage.

Called by many names across the realm - cougar, puma, catamount, ghost cat - mountain lions inspire both admiration and unease. Unlike the social wolves or the imposing bears, mountain lions represent the perfect solitary hunter: silent, efficient, and utterly self-reliant. The mountain tribes of the Cloudpeak Range consider the mountain lion a spiritual teacher, embodying the virtues of patience, stealth, and decisive action.

### In the World

Most common folk live their entire lives without glimpsing a mountain lion in the wild, yet every rural community has its mountain lion tales. Children are warned not to wander alone near rocky outcrops at dusk. Shepherds lose the occasional goat or sheep to these opportunistic hunters. Travelers speak in hushed tones of golden eyes reflecting firelight from the darkness beyond the camp.

Yet attacks on humans remain remarkably rare. Mountain lions vastly prefer their natural prey - deer, elk, even rabbits in lean times - to the risky, unpredictable prospect of engaging people. The few attacks that do occur usually involve starving animals in particularly harsh winters, or the tragic circumstance of someone stumbling upon a mother's den. Most encounters end with the cat simply vanishing, leaving only tracks and a racing heart as evidence it was ever there.

For hunters skilled enough to track and take a mountain lion, the rewards justify the challenge. Mountain lion pelts, with their distinctive tawny coloring and impossibly soft texture, command premium prices among nobles and wealthy merchants. A cloak edged with mountain lion fur marks its wearer as someone who can afford the exotic and exclusive. Alchemists value mountain lion components for potions of stealth and agility, while craftspeople prize the sinews for their exceptional strength and flexibility.
