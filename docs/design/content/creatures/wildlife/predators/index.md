## Threat Assessment

### Wolves

**Primary Danger:** Pack coordination

- Intelligent tactics: flanking, focus fire, retreat coordination
- Most dangerous at night
- Howls alert other packs to your presence

**Recommended Party Size:** 2-4 for small pack, 4-6 for large pack

### Mountain Lions

**Primary Danger:** Ambush from stealth

- You likely won't see it until it attacks
- First strike does massive damage
- Prefers high ground and surprise
- Usually flees if ambush fails

**Recommended Party Size:** 2-3 (if you can find it first)

### Bears

**Primary Danger:** Overwhelming physical power

- Can kill in a single attack sequence
- Thick hide reduces damage taken
- Mother bears are death incarnate
- Roar can break party morale

**Recommended Party Size:** 4-6 well-equipped fighters
