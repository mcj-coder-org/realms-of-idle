# Wolf

## Lore

### Origin

Wolves are the shadow that follows civilization's light - never far from settlements, yet never truly of them. These cunning predators have prowled the forests and mountains since time immemorial, their howls echoing through the night as ancient and primal as the moon they sing to. Every culture has wolf stories: some paint them as villains stealing livestock and children, others as noble hunters deserving respect.

The rangers of the Northern Watch maintain that wolves are neither good nor evil, simply wild. They hunt to feed their pack, defend their territory, and raise their young. The fact that their needs sometimes conflict with human interests doesn't make them monsters - it makes them survivors. Many a ranger has learned tracking from studying wolf packs, observing their coordination and tactical awareness.

### In the World

Every rural community knows the wolf song. That long, haunting howl drifting across the darkening fields means farmers check the livestock pens twice before bed and bar the doors more firmly. Shepherds light extra fires on winter nights when the pack is hunting close, and parents hurry children inside when twilight comes early.

Yet wolves rarely attack humans without cause. Most conflicts arise when desperate packs, their natural prey scarce, turn to sheep and cattle out of hunger. Wise village elders negotiate with local rangers to maintain the balance - controlled hunts to keep pack numbers reasonable, bounties on problem wolves, but also respect for territories and breeding seasons. The old ways teach that eliminating all wolves invites worse problems: unchecked rabbit populations destroying crops, deer overpopulating and starving, the forest's careful balance undone.

Wolf pelts command high prices in town markets. The thick winter coat makes superior cloaks and trim for cold-weather gear. Hunters who can take down a wolf without damaging the pelt earn respect and coin both. Wolf teeth become trophies and talismans, symbols of courage and skill in the hunt. Some alchemists pay well for wolf organs, claiming potions brewed with wolf heart grant courage, while wolf eyes improve night vision.
