# Giant Eagle

## Lore

### Origin

Giant eagles soar through legend and reality alike, their wingspans casting shadows the size of cottages across mountain valleys. These magnificent creatures are not merely larger versions of common birds - they possess an intelligence that borders on sapience, a dignity that commands respect, and a presence that transforms mere flight into something approaching divinity.

The mountain peoples speak of ancient pacts between humans and eagles, agreements forged in the Age of Wonder when the boundaries between beast and enlightened being were less clearly drawn. Some giant eagles still honor these old bonds, occasionally aiding travelers lost in mountain passes or warning settlements of approaching storms. Others remain aloof, judging all earthbound creatures beneath their notice.

Scholars debate whether giant eagles are natural creatures grown to extraordinary size through magic-rich environments, or whether they represent a separate species entirely. The eagles themselves offer no answers, and approaching one to ask would require courage bordering on foolishness.

### In the World

To witness a giant eagle in flight is considered profoundly lucky - some say it's a sign of great changes ahead, others that it portends important choices. Mountain rangers learn to read eagle flight patterns, claiming the birds' behavior predicts weather more reliably than any instrument. When eagles circle before a storm, wise travelers seek shelter immediately.

Giant eagles nest in the highest, most inaccessible peaks, their eyries visible only as distant specks even with a spyglass. The nests themselves are massive constructions of trees and stone, accumulated over generations. A single giant eagle may use the same nest for its entire life, adding to it yearly, creating structures that become landmarks visible for miles.

The relationship between humans and giant eagles is complex. The birds occasionally hunt livestock, but far less often than their size would suggest - they seem to prefer wild prey and show remarkable restraint near settlements that treat them with respect. Rangers tell of eagles that have guided lost climbers to safety, or dropped fish to stranded travelers. These acts of apparent kindness only deepen the mystery surrounding their true nature.

Feathers shed by giant eagles are treasured beyond gold. A single primary feather, as long as a man's arm and strong enough to use as a walking stick, can be fashioned into a banner that never tears or fades. Smaller feathers make arrow fletching of unmatched quality, though most fletchers consider using them sacrilegious. The handful of cultures that have eagles' permission to harvest fallen feathers guard this privilege zealously.
