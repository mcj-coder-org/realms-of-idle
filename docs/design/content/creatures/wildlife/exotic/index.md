# Exotic Wildlife

Extraordinary creatures that transcend ordinary animal classification. These beings possess exceptional size, intelligence, or mystical properties while remaining fundamentally part of the natural world rather than purely magical constructs.

| --------------------------------------- | ----- | --------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| [Giant Eagle](giant-eagle/index.md)     | 15-20 | High mountains  | Rare      | Exceptional beast |

### Exotic vs Magical

**Exotic Wildlife:** Rare natural creatures with exceptional traits

- Still fundamentally animals
- Reproduce naturally
- Tied to specific ecosystems
- Harvestable for resources
- Subject to natural laws (with exceptions)

**Magical Creatures:** Beings of magical origin (covered separately)

- May be summoned or created
- Magical sustenance
- Can exist outside normal ecology
- Different interaction rules

## Interaction Guidelines

### Giant Eagle

**Approach:**

- Extremely dangerous in combat
- Often protected by law and custom
- Hunting them damages reputation severely
- Best observed from great distance
- Fallen feathers can sometimes be found legally

**Cultural Context:**

- Sacred to many mountain peoples
- Sign of good fortune when sighted
- Ancient pacts with some human groups
- Trophy hunting is cultural taboo

**Practical Interaction:**

- Weather prediction (observe flight patterns)
- Guide when lost (if eagle chooses)
- Leave livestock alone if shown respect
- Bond possible but legendary rare

### Forest Spirit

**Approach:**

- Cannot be fought in traditional sense
- Embodies entire forest ecosystem
- Judges intentions, not actions alone
- Respond to respect with gifts
- Violation brings lasting consequences

**Cultural Context:**

- Sacred to druids and rangers
- Central to nature worship
- Symbol of wild places' sanctity
- Marks truly ancient forests

**Practical Interaction:**

- Show respect: small offerings, careful harvesting
- Avoid: excessive logging, pollution, cruelty
- Seek guidance: meditate in sacred groves
- Learn: signs of spirit presence
- Never: attempt to bind, trap, or harm

## Encounter Difficulty

### Combat Ratings

| Creature      | Solo Adventurer | Small Party (2-4) | Full Party (5-6) |
| ------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Giant Eagle   | Lethal          | Very Hard         | Hard             |
| Forest Spirit | Impossible      | Impossible        | Impossible\*     |

\*Forest spirits don't engage in traditional combat. "Fighting" one means being lost in the forest, having time flow strangely, or being judged unworthy and expelled.

### Survival Strategies

**Giant Eagle:**

- Don't engage unless absolutely necessary
- Seek cover (ruins, caves, dense forest)
- Heavy armor helps vs diving strikes
- Ranged weapons most effective
- Flight magic or high ground essential
- Never attack near nesting sites

**Forest Spirit:**

- Show immediate respect
- State peaceful intentions clearly
- Leave offerings if possible
- Back away slowly
- Do not harm forest while present
- If time seems strange, don't panic
- Follow subtle signs to exit

## Resources and Value

### Giant Eagle Components

| Component Type   | Value Range      | Legal Status          | Uses                |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Primary Feathers | 100-500 gold ea  | Protected most places | Banners, ceremonies |
| Flight Feathers  | 50-200 gold ea   | Protected             | Supreme arrows      |
| Talons           | 200-400 gold ea  | Protected             | Ceremonial weapons  |
| Down             | 500-1000 gold/lb | Protected             | Lightest insulation |

**Legal Note:** Possessing eagle parts usually requires proof they were found naturally fallen or obtained from licensed sources. Black market prices are higher but carry severe legal consequences.

### Forest Spirit Gifts

| Gift Type      | Value         | Acquisition                      | Properties           |
| -------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Spirit Moss    | 1000+ gold    | Found at manifestation sites     | Alchemy reagent      |
| Blessed Wood   | 2000+ gold    | Fallen branches only             | Never rots, magical  |
| Ethereal Bloom | 5000+ gold    | Appears after positive encounter | Transcendent potions |
| Spirit Dew     | 500 gold/vial | Morning after visitation         | Cures diseases       |
| Ancient Seed   | Priceless     | Extremely rare gift              | Grows wondrous trees |

**Critical Note:** These cannot be harvested forcefully. Attempting to do so destroys their properties and likely earns a spirit's enmity.

## Population and Conservation

### Status in the World

**Giant Eagles:**

- Population: Estimated 300-500 in the known realm
- Threats: Trophy hunting, habitat loss, human expansion
- Protection: Sacred to mountain peoples, protected by many kingdoms
- Breeding: Slow (one egg every few years, 20-year maturity)
- Trend: Stable in protected regions, declining near expanding settlements

**Forest Spirits:**

- Population: One per truly ancient forest (maybe 50-100 total)
- Threats: Deforestation, pollution, breaking of ancient groves
- Protection: Sacred sites, druidic guardianship, local taboos
- Formation: Unknown (centuries? millennia?)
- Trend: Declining as old forests fall; some forests now spirit-less

## Cultural Significance

### In Different Societies

**Mountain Kingdoms:**

- Giant eagles feature in heraldry
- Eagle riders are legendary heroes
- Hunting eagles is high crime
- Eyries are pilgrimage sites

**Forest Peoples:**

- Forest spirits are objects of worship
- Spirit-blessed groves are capitals
- Druids commune with spirits
- Harming spirits = ultimate sin

**Urban Centers:**

- Both seen as myths/exaggerations
- Merchants trade in (often illegal) parts
- Scholars debate their true nature
- Adventurers seek them for glory/profit
