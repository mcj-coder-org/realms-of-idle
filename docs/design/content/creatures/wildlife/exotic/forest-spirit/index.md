# Forest Spirit

## Lore

### Origin

Forest spirits exist in the liminal space between the physical and magical, neither fully one nor the other. They are the forest's consciousness made manifest, the accumulated essence of centuries of growth, decay, and renewal given form and purpose. To encounter a forest spirit is to stand before the woodland itself, to be judged by something older and wiser than cities or kingdoms.

No two forest spirits appear exactly alike. Some manifest as luminous deer with antlers that sprout flowering branches, others as bears whose fur ripples like water and whose eyes hold starlight. Still others appear as floating orbs of gentle light, or as impossibly ancient trees that move with glacial grace. The form matters less than the presence - that unmistakable sense of standing before something sacred and wild.

The oldest tales speak of druids who could commune with forest spirits, learning the deep secrets of growing things. These partnerships shaped the early relationship between humans and the wilderness, teaching which plants heal and which harm, which paths lead home and which lead deeper into mystery. Modern scholars debate whether forest spirits are conscious entities or elaborate magical phenomena, but those who have encountered them speak with certainty: the spirits are aware, they remember, and they judge.

### In the World

Most people live their entire lives without seeing a forest spirit, though many claim to have felt their presence - that peculiar sensation of being watched benevolently while deep in old-growth woods, or the inexplicable sense of which direction leads to safety when lost. Forest spirits rarely reveal themselves to those who would harm their domain, but to those who show respect, they offer subtle guidance.

The rangers of the Greenwood Alliance teach their trainees to recognize signs of spirit activity: paths that seem to shift slightly day to day, clearings that always feel peaceful regardless of weather, trees that grow in patterns no natural force would create. Where forest spirits dwell, the forest thrives in ways that transcend ordinary ecology - predators and prey find balance without the usual boom-bust cycles, seasons flow smoothly into one another, and the very air seems to hum with quiet vitality.

In practical terms, harming a forest spirit is nearly impossible and attempting it invites disaster. The rare hunters foolish enough to try report wounds that don't heal properly, paths that lead in circles, and game that vanishes at their approach. More severe violations of the forest's peace have resulted in entire hunting parties becoming permanently lost, or emerging from woods after what felt like hours to find months had passed.

The wise know that forest spirits are not entities to bargain with or hunt, but presences to respect. Herbalists leave small offerings at the base of ancient trees before harvesting. Loggers consult with rangers to ensure they're not cutting in spirit-protected groves. Travelers who show proper reverence sometimes find berries growing unseasonably along their path, or streams that lead unerringly toward civilization.

### Behavior

| Behavior      | Details                                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Territory     | Entire forest is its domain                     |
| Awareness     | Knows all that occurs within its forest         |
| Manifestation | Appears/disappears at will                      |
| Communication | Empathic sense, dreams, natural signs           |

### Combat

| Property       | Value                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Damage         | Moderate to Very High (circumstantial)          |
| Defense        | Extreme (intangible, regenerates)               |
| Primary Tactic | Indirect (confusion, misdirection)              |
| Direct Combat  | Only when forest critically threatened          |

| Immortal       | Cannot be truly killed (reforms over time)      |
| Retreat        | Fades into forest when manifestation threatened |

**Combat Notes:** Forest spirits almost never engage in direct combat. Instead, they influence the environment:

- Paths loop endlessly
- Predators arrive to defend
- Roots entangle intruders
- Weather turns hostile
- Time flows strangely

If forced to manifest and fight directly (a catastrophic situation), they wield nature magic of terrifying power.

### "Harvestables"

Forest spirits cannot be hunted in any meaningful sense. However, areas where they have manifested sometimes yield:

| Resource       | Uses                                  | Yield        | Acquisition                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Spirit Moss    | Alchemy (powerful reagent)            | 1-2 handfuls | Found at manifestation sites |
| Blessed Wood   | Crafting (never rots, resists damage) | 1-3 pieces   | Fallen branches only         |
| Ethereal Bloom | Alchemy (transcendent potions)        | 1-2 flowers  | Appears after encounter      |
| Spirit Dew     | Healing (cures diseases/poison)       | Small vial   | Morning after visitation     |
| Ancient Seed   | Planting (grows wondrous trees)       | 1 seed       | Extremely rare gift          |

**Critical Note:** These are not harvested from the spirit itself but are gifts the forest offers after positive encounters. Attempting to forcibly gather them causes their magical properties to fade.

### Taming

| Property        | Value                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Tameable        | No (categorical impossibility)          |
| Befriendable    | Yes (through years of respect)          |
| Requirements    | Genuine love of nature; pure intentions |
| Relationship    | Partnership, never ownership            |
| Cultural Impact | Legendary status; spiritual authority   |

Forest spirits cannot be tamed, controlled, or bound. They may choose to befriend exceptionally worthy individuals, but this is a relationship between equals, not master and servant.

### Encounter Types

| Encounter Type       | Likelihood | Character Response                     |
| -------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Distant Sensing      | Common     | Feel watched; paths seem easier        |
| Subtle Presence      | Uncommon   | Glimpse ethereal form; sense approval  |
| Direct Manifestation | Rare       | Full encounter; possible communication |
| Gift Bestowal        | Very Rare  | Receive blessing or special item       |
| Active Intervention  | Rare       | Spirit manifests to prevent disaster   |
