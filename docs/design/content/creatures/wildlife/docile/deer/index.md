# Deer

## Lore

### Origin

Deer move through the forests like living poetry, their graceful bounds and alert stillness capturing something essential about the wild places of the world. These creatures have walked the realm since ancient times, their images carved into standing stones from the Age of Wonder and painted on cave walls that predate written history.

The Forest Wardens of Greenwood speak of a covenant between deer and civilized folk - take what you need, waste nothing, and the forest will provide. Hunters who follow these principles find deer tracks leading to clear shots, while those who hunt with greed or cruelty find the forest suddenly, inexplicably empty. Whether this is deer wisdom, forest magic, or coincidence, none can say for certain.

### In the World

Venison graces tables from the humblest farmhouse to the grandest castle. A successful deer hunt means weeks of good eating - roasts for special occasions, stews to stretch the meat further, and sausages to preserve what can't be eaten fresh. In rural communities, the hunter who brings down a deer often shares portions with neighbors, strengthening social bonds through this ancient tradition.

Deer leather is prized above almost any other animal hide. Soft yet durable, it works up into fine gloves, supple boots, and armor that doesn't restrict movement. Master leatherworkers can tell you the age, sex, and even the region where a deer lived just by examining its hide. The leather merchants of Tradetown pay premium prices for quality deer pelts, making hunting both a survival skill and a viable profession.

Every autumn, when bucks grow their antlers, crafters scour the forests for shed velvet and fallen antlers. These materials, imbued with natural magic from their rapid growth, serve alchemists and enchanters well. A potion brewed with deer antler velvet promotes healing and vitality, while antler-tipped staves channel nature magic with particular clarity.
