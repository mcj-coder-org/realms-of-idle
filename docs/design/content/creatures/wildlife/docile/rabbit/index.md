# Rabbit

## Lore

### Origin

Rabbits are among the most common creatures in the realm, their soft brown fur and twitching noses familiar sights in meadows, forest edges, and even well-tended gardens (much to farmers' chagrin). These gentle creatures have lived alongside civilization since the first settlements, neither tamed nor truly wild, existing in that comfortable space between.

In the rural villages of the Millbrook region, rabbits are considered good luck. Spotting a white rabbit on the morning of market day means profitable trading, or so the saying goes. Children learn to identify rabbit tracks early, and many a young hunter starts their training tracking these swift, clever creatures through the underbrush.

### In the World

Every cook knows rabbit meat makes for hearty stews and tender roasts. During harvest season, farmers set gentle snares at field edges - not to eliminate the rabbits entirely (that would be impossible and unwise), but to keep their numbers manageable while adding variety to the family table. The practice is so common that "checking the rabbit snares" is a standard morning chore for farm children.

Rabbit fur, soft and warm, lines winter cloaks and trims hoods against the cold. Tanner apprentices often practice their craft on rabbit pelts before moving to larger, more valuable hides. In the mountain settlements where winters bite hard, rabbit fur mittens are a traditional gift for newborns, symbolizing warmth and protection.

The alchemists of the Herbalist Guild pay fair coin for rabbit organs, particularly the liver and heart, which serve as components in stamina-restoration potions. A hunter who knows their way around an alchemist's shopping list can turn a morning's hunt into a week's wages.
