# Songbird

## Lore

### Origin

The morning chorus of songbirds is as much a part of village life as the ringing of temple bells. These small, brightly-feathered creatures fill the air with melody from first light until dusk, their varied songs marking the changing seasons as reliably as any calendar. Scholars have catalogued over fifty distinct songbird species across the realm, each with its own plumage pattern and distinctive call.

Bards claim that the first songs were taught to humanity by birds, and whether or not that's true, every culture has its bird-song folklore. In the Millbrook region, a robin's nest above your door means a year of good fortune. Mountain folk believe that hearing a thrush sing at dawn on your birthday grants a wish. Sailors say that land birds approaching a ship are messengers from loved ones back home.

### In the World

Songbirds enliven every garden and forest edge. Farmers consider them allies in the eternal war against crop-eating insects, and many plant berry bushes specifically to attract birds to their fields. Children learn to identify common species by their songs before they can read - "That's a robin" or "Listen, the larks are starting" becomes as natural as recognizing neighbors' voices.

In towns and cities, songbirds nest in eaves and garden trees, bringing a touch of nature to urban life. The wealthy keep aviaries with exotic singing species, competing to own the rarest plumages or the most melodious voices. The Queen's private garden is said to host fifty songbird species, their combined chorus audible throughout the palace grounds.

Crafters value songbird feathers for their beauty and lightness. A cloak trimmed with songbird feathers in blues and greens marks a master tailor's work. Fletchers use specific feathers for balance in fine arrows. Scribes favor songbird quills for their flexibility, and every apprentice learns to trim their first quill from a donated songbird feather.
