# Comfort

## Lore

### Origin

Comfort enchantments emerged from a simple truth: uncomfortable clothing makes everything harder. A [Tailor](../../classes/index.md) named Elise Softweave grew frustrated watching customers purchase beautiful garments that went unworn because they chafed, pinched, or simply felt wrong. She developed an enchantment that made clothing feel perfectly fitted, naturally breathable, and effortlessly comfortable regardless of activity or weather conditions.

The enchantment works by creating a subtle cushioning field between fabric and skin, adjusting pressure points, and regulating micro-climate. Tight collars don't choke. Stiff fabrics drape naturally. Seams never irritate. Wearers often forget they're dressed at all - the clothing becomes an extension of their body rather than something endured. Master enchanters describe Comfort as "teaching fabric to care about the wearer."

### In the World

Comfort-enchanted clothing transformed from luxury to necessity for working professionals. [Guards](../../classes/index.md) wearing Comfort-enchanted uniforms can patrol all day without chafing. [Farmers](../../classes/index.md) work from dawn to dusk in Comfort-enchanted overalls without fatigue. [Performers](../../classes/index.md) wear elaborate costumes that look restrictive but feel like nightgowns. Even the wealthy prize Comfort enchantments - beauty means nothing if you can't wait to remove it.

The enchantment has unexpected social benefits. Comfort-enchanted school uniforms help children focus on learning rather than discomfort. Comfort-enchanted work clothes reduce injury from poor ergonomics. Some progressive [Guilds](../../classes/index.md) provide Comfort-enchanted gear to apprentices, viewing it as occupational health investment. And every parent knows that Comfort-enchanted children's clothing means fewer complaints and tantrums.
