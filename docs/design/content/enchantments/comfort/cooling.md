# Cooling

## Lore

### Origin

Cooling enchantments emerged from desert cultures where heat kills as surely as cold. The first Cooling robes let [Desert Nomads](../../classes/index.md) travel under the burning sun in comfort, their bodies cool despite temperatures that would incapacitate others. Unlike mundane ventilation that merely circulates hot air, Cooling enchantments actively draw heat away from the wearer, maintaining comfortable temperature through magical heat dissipation.

The enchantment creates a micro-climate around the wearer, channeling excess body heat outward while preventing environmental heat from penetrating inward. It's essentially Cold Resistance working in reverse - keeping external heat out rather than external cold. The magic is subtle enough that wearers don't feel artificially chilled, just naturally comfortable regardless of ambient temperature. Master enchanters describe Cooling as "teaching fabric to breathe ice."

### In the World

Cooling-enchanted clothing revolutionized hot-climate living. Desert cities flourished as workers could labor through midday heat. Tropical regions became habitable for those from temperate zones. [Blacksmiths](../../classes/index.md) work forges without heatstroke thanks to Cooling aprons. [Farmers](../../classes/index.md) harvest under full sun without exhaustion. Even common laborers in hot regions consider Cooling-enchanted work clothes essential rather than luxury.

The enchantment transformed industries reliant on heat. Forge workers, bakers, glassblowers, and smelters all benefit from Cooling protection. Some [Guilds](../../classes/index.md) require Cooling gear for dangerous heat-exposure jobs. Wealthy estates in hot climates provide Cooling uniforms to staff. And every parent in desert regions saves for Cooling-enchanted school uniforms - heatstroke in children is no longer acceptable when prevention exists.

### Combination Strategies

**Desert Survival:**

- Cooling III robes (body protection)
- Cooling III headwrap (head coverage critical)
- Cooling II undergarments (full coverage)
- Light-colored outer layers (reflects sun, backup cooling)

**Hot Profession (Forge/Kitchen):**

- Cooling IV/V apron (direct heat source)
- Cooling III base clothing (ambient heat)
- Cooling III head covering (brain protection)
- Regular heat-resistant gloves (physical burn protection)

**Summer Comfort:**

- Cooling I-II everyday clothes
- Cooling II hat for sun exposure
- Regular light fabrics (cooling backup)

### Economic Considerations

**Regional Necessity:**

- Desert regions: Cooling I-II as basic necessity
- Tropical zones: Standard equipment
- Hot professions: Required safety gear
- Temperate climates: Summer luxury

**Energy Economics:**

- Reduces cooling costs (fans, ice, air magic)
- Enables midday outdoor work (productivity gains)
- Lower water consumption (less sweating)
- Health cost savings (fewer heat illnesses)

**Industry Impact:**

- Hot-work professions become safer
- Summer construction more efficient
- Desert/tropical regions economically viable
- Food production (cooking, baking) less dangerous

### Health and Safety

**Medical Benefits:**

- Prevents heat exhaustion
- Reduces heat stroke risk
- Helps cardiovascular health (less heat stress)
- Enables outdoor activity for elderly in heat
- Reduces heat-related illness

**Safety Applications:**

- Emergency desert survival
- Fire-adjacent work (forges, bakeries)
- Volcanic region exploration
- Military operations in hot zones
- Rescue work in heat conditions

### Stacking and Combos

- **With Comfort:** Cool AND perfectly fitted
- **With Cleanliness:** Cool, fresh, and clean always
- **With Durability:** Long-lasting hot-weather gear
- **Full Summer Set:** Cooling + Comfort + Cleanliness = perfect hot weather wear

### Limitations

**Does Not:**

- Protect against ice/cold (use Warmth instead)
- Provide insulation if enchantment fails (still need sun protection)
- Work in anti-magic zones
- Cool others nearby (only wearer benefits)
- Generate visible cold (no frost/ice)

**Power Management:**

- Constant drain while in heat
- Recharge needed annually with moderate use
- Heavy desert/forge use requires more frequent recharge
- Some variants allow manual on/off to conserve power

| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Survival    | Essential for hot-climate operations       |
| Health      | Prevents heat-related illnesses            |
| Comfort     | Working in heat becomes tolerable          |
| Exploration | Opens previously uninhabitable hot regions |
| Economy     | Enables year-round hot-region productivity |
| Hydration   | Reduces water needs (less sweating)        |
