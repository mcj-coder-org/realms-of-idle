# Warmth

## Lore

### Origin

Warmth enchantments were born from necessity in the frozen north, where survival depends on staying warm but bulk inhibits movement. The first Warmth-enchanted cloaks let [Rangers](../../classes/index.md) track through snowstorms in light clothing, their bodies comfortably warm despite subzero temperatures. Unlike mundane layers that trap body heat, Warmth enchantments generate gentle magical heating, providing winter protection without the weight and restriction of heavy furs.

The enchantment works by creating a thin layer of warm air between clothing and skin, maintained at perfect temperature regardless of external conditions. It's not true heat generation - that would burn the wearer - but rather a constant gentle warmth that prevents cold from penetrating. Master enchanters note that Warmth is technically a variant of Fire Resistance working in reverse, keeping external cold out rather than external heat.

### In the World

Warmth-enchanted clothing democratized cold-weather survival. Before Warmth, only wealthy could afford enough furs and wool to survive harsh winters. Now, a simple Warmth-enchanted underlayer keeps anyone comfortable in freezing conditions. Northern settlements flourished as workers could labor outdoors year-round. Trade routes opened through mountain passes previously impassable in winter. Arctic expeditions became feasible for explorers beyond the extremely wealthy.

The enchantment has become everyday infrastructure in cold regions. Northern [Guilds](../../classes/index.md) provide Warmth-enchanted work clothes as standard. Schools in mountain villages issue Warmth-enchanted uniforms. Even modest families save for Warmth-enchanted winter coats for children. Some progressive cities offer Warmth-enchanted public cloaks at warming stations, ensuring no one freezes during cold snaps. And every northern grandmother has stories about surviving blizzards thanks to Warmth-enchanted shawls.

### Combination Strategies

**Arctic Survival Setup:**

- Warmth V base layer (maximum heating)
- Warmth IV overcoat (redundancy)
- Warmth V gloves, boots, hat (extremity protection)
- Regular insulating layers (backup if anti-magic)

**Everyday Winter Use:**

- Warmth II underlayer (daily comfort)
- Regular winter coat (backup warmth, weather protection)
- Warmth II gloves (hand protection)
- Normal winter accessories

**Professional Work:**

- Warmth III work clothes (all-day outdoor)
- Warmth III boots (prevent foot numbness)
- Regular outer layers (physical protection)

### Economic Considerations

**Individual Investment:**

- Level I-II: Affordable comfort upgrade
- Level III: Standard for cold regions (1-2 weeks wages)
- Level IV-V: Professional/expedition gear (expensive but essential)

**Regional Infrastructure:**

- Northern settlements: Warmth I-II as basic necessity
- Mountain communities: Public Warmth-enchanted facilities
- Arctic regions: High-level Warmth required for survival
- Moderate climates: Luxury/seasonal use only

**Energy Savings:**

- Reduces need for heating fuel (wood, coal)
- Lower indoor heating requirements
- Outdoor work doesn't need warming breaks
- Overall household heating costs reduced 30-50%

### Health and Safety

**Medical Benefits:**

- Prevents hypothermia
- Reduces cold-weather illness
- Helps circulation (elderly, disabilities)
- Prevents frostbite on extremities
- Reduces arthritis pain in cold weather

**Safety Applications:**

- Emergency survival gear
- Rescue worker equipment
- Military cold-weather operations
- Lost traveler protection
- Homeless support in cold regions

### Stacking and Combos

- **With Comfort:** Warm AND perfectly fitted
- **With Durability:** Long-lasting winter gear
- **With Waterproofing:** Warm and dry in snow/rain
- **Full Winter Set:** Warmth + Comfort + Cleanliness = perfect winter wear

### Limitations

**Does Not:**

- Protect against fire (use Fire Resistance instead)
- Provide insulation if enchantment fails (carry backup layers)
- Work in anti-magic zones
- Keep others warm (only wearer benefits)
- Generate visible heat (no flames/glow)

**Power Management:**

- Constant low drain on enchantment
- Recharge needed annually in moderate use
- Heavy arctic use requires more frequent recharge
- Some variants allow manual on/off to conserve power
