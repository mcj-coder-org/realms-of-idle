# Cleanliness

## Lore

### Origin

Cleanliness enchantments emerged from royal courts where appearance determined social standing. A [Court Enchanter](../../classes/index.md) named Pristine Whitehall (born Margaret Brown, renamed after her invention) grew tired of nobles complaining about laundry servants ruining expensive garments. She developed an enchantment that made clothing repel dirt, stains, and odors automatically. The fabric stayed perpetually clean as if freshly laundered, requiring actual washing only rarely.

The enchantment works through a subtle repulsion field - dirt, liquids, and odors simply don't adhere to the fabric. Mud slides off. Wine beads away. Food stains can't form. Sweat evaporates without leaving smell. At higher levels, the enchantment actively cleans existing dirt, gradually restoring garments to pristine condition overnight. Master enchanters describe Cleanliness as "teaching fabric to reject impurity."

### In the World

Cleanliness-enchanted clothing transformed from luxury to professional necessity. [Healers](../../classes/index.md) wear Cleanliness-enchanted robes that never carry contamination between patients. [Cooks](../../classes/index.md) work in Cleanliness aprons that repel food stains. [Nobles](../../classes/index.md) maintain perfect appearance without armies of laundry servants. Even common workers prize Cleanliness-enchanted work clothes - the same outfit works day after day without washing, saving water, time, and wear from repeated laundering.

The enchantment has unexpected economic impacts. Laundry servants shifted from washing to repairs and alterations. Water usage in cities dropped 20-30% as Cleanliness reduced washing frequency. Clothing lasts longer without harsh laundering chemicals. Some progressive cities provide Cleanliness-enchanted uniforms to [School Children](../../classes/index.md), improving health by preventing disease transmission while reducing family laundry burdens. And every traveler considers Cleanliness-enchanted clothes essential - pack less, stay fresh longer.

### Stacking and Combos

- **With Comfort:** Clean AND perfectly comfortable
- **With Durability:** Clean clothes that last forever
- **With Warmth/Cooling:** Clean, temperature-perfect clothing
- **Full Quality Set:** Cleanliness + Comfort + Durability = ultimate wardrobe

### Limitations

**Does Not:**

- Repair physical damage (tears, holes - use Durability)
- Remove set-in stains from before enchanting (start fresh)
- Clean without magic (anti-magic zones = normal clothing)
- Replace bathing (person still needs hygiene)
- Clean other items (only enchanted garment)

**Maintenance:**

- Occasionally wash to "reset" enchantment (annual)
- Physical damage may compromise enchantment
- Very heavy soiling (Level I-II) may need assistance
- Recharge every few years depending on use

**Psychological Adjustment:**

- First week: feels wrong not washing
- First month: trust the enchantment
- After: can't imagine going back
- Important: personal hygiene still required!
