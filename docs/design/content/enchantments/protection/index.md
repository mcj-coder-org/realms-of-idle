## Category Overview

**Primary Users:** Adventurers, guards, soldiers, workers in dangerous professions

**Stacking:** Protection enchantments stack additively with caps. Protection III armor + Protection II shield = Protection IV equivalent (capped at level V).

**Best Combinations:**

- Protection + Resistance (any) = Layered defense
- Protection + Thorns = Defensive + offensive capability
- Protection + Regeneration = Damage mitigation + healing

**Budget Recommendations:**

- Essential (adventurers): Protection II (60c minimum)
- Specialized needs: Single Resistance variant (150c+)
- Comprehensive defense: Multiple Resistance pieces (600c+)
- Professional (soldiers): Protection III + Thorns (700c+)
