# Protection

## Lore

### Origin

Protection is the foundation upon which all defensive enchantments are built. The enchantment emerged from shield-mages who sought to extend their protective barriers beyond spell duration. By weaving defensive magic directly into wearable items, they created protection that didn't require constant concentration. The first Protection-enchanted piece was a simple leather vest that stopped a crossbow bolt cold - the apprentice enchanter who created it promptly received a promotion and a contract with the city guard.

Every enchanter learns Protection as their first defensive enchantment. It's forgiving, stable, and remarkably difficult to mess up catastrophically. The worst failure produces items that are slightly more protective than unenchanted - hardly a disaster. The best successes create protection that turns mortal wounds into bruises, giving warriors a fighting chance to see their families again.

### In the World

Protection-enchanted gear is the equipment of professionals. Guards on city walls wear it. Caravan escorts rely on it. Adventurers save their coins to afford it. The enchantment doesn't make you invincible - arrows still hurt, swords still cut - but it takes the edge off. A blade that would have cleaved through ribs glances off instead. A fall that would break bones leaves only aches.

Parents in prosperous families gift Protection-enchanted leather vests to their children when they come of age and leave for the city. It's practical protection combined with symbolic care - "I can't be there to shield you, but this can." The [Merchant's Guild](../../classes/index.md) requires all members traveling dangerous routes to wear at least basic Protection-enchanted gear. Some cities offer Protection enchantments as rewards for community service, acknowledging that safe citizens make strong communities.
