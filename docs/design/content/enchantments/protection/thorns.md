# Thorns

## Lore

### Origin

Thorns enchantment emerged from a defensive philosophy: the best way to discourage attackers is to make attacking painful. Named after the protective spines of rosebushes and hedgehogs, Thorns creates a magical barrier that punishes those who strike the wearer. The first Thorns-enchanted piece was created by a frontier settler tired of bandits - after a few raiders discovered their victims bit back, attacks diminished considerably.

The enchantment channels kinetic energy from incoming strikes and redirects a portion back to the attacker. It's not true reflection - the wearer still takes damage - but enough punishment flows backward to make attackers reconsider their target choice. Master enchanters refined Thorns over generations, ensuring the retaliatory magic distinguishes between hostile attacks and friendly contact. You can still hug someone wearing Thorns without getting hurt.

### In the World

Thorns-enchanted items are popular among those who expect to be outnumbered. Caravan guards facing bandits appreciate the psychological advantage - attackers grow reluctant when every hit costs them health. Dungeon delvers use Thorns against swarms of small creatures, letting the enchantment handle minor threats while they focus on larger dangers. And certain competitive fighters favor Thorns in the arena, turning aggressive opponents' strength against them.

The enchantment has an unexpected social benefit: it reduces bullying and street violence in cities where guards wear Thorns. Drunks who'd take a swing at a guard think twice when they know the punch will hurt them as much as their target. Some schools in dangerous districts provide Thorns-enchanted vests to students, dramatically reducing physical confrontations. The visible magical shimmer around Thorns items serves as a deterrent all by itself.

### Special Properties

| Property         | Effect                                           |

### Material Interactions

| Material                                    | Compatibility | Special Effect                       |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| [Steel](../../materials/metals/index.md)    | Excellent     | Sharp reflection, higher damage      |
| [Leather](../../materials/leather/index.md) | Good          | Blunt reflection, lower damage       |
| [Mithril](../../materials/metals/index.md)  | Good          | Faster retaliation response          |
| [Bronze](../../materials/metals/index.md)   | Fair          | Standard reflection                  |
| [Cloth](../../materials/cloth/index.md)     | Poor          | Weak reflection, primarily deterrent |

### Tactical Considerations

**Effective Against:**

- Multiple weak attackers (swarms, minions)
- Aggressive melee combatants
- Creatures with low HP but high attack frequency
- Grappling opponents

**Less Effective Against:**

- Ranged attackers (arrows, spells)
- High HP enemies (reflection is percentage-based)
- Creatures immune to their own damage type
- Very slow, powerful single strikes

### Stacking and Limits

- **Multiple Pieces:** Reflection percentages stack additively
- **Cap:** Maximum 50% reflection (V + V + V would cap at 50%)
- **Per-Hit Maximum:** Even 50% reflection capped at individual piece maximums
- **Full Set Example:** 5 pieces at Level II = 50% reflection (capped), max 10/hit per piece

### Interactions

| System     | Interaction                                        |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Combat     | Damages melee attackers automatically              |
| Psychology | Visible deterrent effect on intelligent enemies    |
| Stacking   | Multiple Thorns pieces multiply reflection         |
| Magic      | Does not prevent incoming damage, only reflects it |
| Social     | May be restricted in sparring/practice scenarios   |
| Wildlife   | Animals learn to avoid Thorns-enchanted people     |

### Side Effects

**Considerations:**

- High-level Thorns can accidentally harm training partners
- May trigger on surprise friendly contact (back slaps, shoulder grabs)
- Visible effect makes stealth difficult
- Some religious orders view retaliation magic as contrary to mercy
- Arena rules often restrict or ban Thorns enchantments
