# Resistance

## Lore

### Origin

Resistance enchantments evolved from specialized protective magic used by explorers venturing into hostile environments. Fire walkers needed heat protection. Arctic expeditions required cold resistance. Storm sailors demanded lightning deflection. Rather than casting temporary protection spells repeatedly, enchanters learned to embed elemental resistance directly into wearable items, creating permanent safeguards against specific threats.

The key breakthrough was understanding that different damage types require different defensive approaches. Fire needs to be diverted and cooled. Cold must be insulated against. Lightning requires grounding. Each Resistance variant uses unique reagents and inscription patterns. A journeyman enchanter who masters all four elemental Resistances demonstrates both technical skill and theoretical understanding - they're ready to tackle more complex defensive magic.

### In the World

Ask veterans what enchantment saved their lives, and many will name Resistance. The dragon hunter whose Fire Resistance armor let them survive a breath weapon. The deep delver whose Cold Resistance kept them functional in frozen ruins. The storm-ship sailor whose Lightning Resistance meant walking away from a direct strike. These aren't exotic scenarios - they're Tuesday for professionals who work in dangerous places.

Resistance-enchanted gear comes in specialized variants for different professions. [Blacksmiths](../../classes/index.md) wear Fire Resistance aprons. [Alchemists](../../classes/index.md) favor Poison Resistance gloves. Northern traders invest in Cold Resistance cloaks. Some enchanters offer custom resistance portfolios - multiple items with different Resistance types, letting the wearer swap based on expected threats. The smart adventurer brings at least one Resistance piece appropriate to their destination.
