# Restoration Enchantments

## Category Overview

**Primary Users:** Adventurers, soldiers, heirloom item owners, master craftspeople

**Value Proposition:** Restoration enchantments are expensive upfront but provide unlimited value over time.

**Regeneration Details:**

- Continuous passive HP healing
- Doubles effectiveness during sleep (60-360 HP/hour sleeping)
- Best on body-contact items (armor 100%, rings 90%, boots 60%)
- Stacks additively across multiple items (diminishing returns apply)
- Emergency healing in combat situations
- Long-term health maintenance

**Auto-Repair Details:**

- Items self-restore durability over time
- Level I: 1%/hour (full repair in ~4 days from heavily damaged)
- Level V: 10%/hour (full repair in ~10 hours)
- Master tier (expensive: 3000c-200000c)
- Combined with Unbreaking = near-eternal items
- Heirloom quality - items last centuries with minimal maintenance

**Best Combinations:**

- **Extreme Healing:** Regeneration + Vampiric = combat healing focus
- **Eternal Items:** Auto-Repair + Unbreaking = generational durability
- **Adventurer Standard:** Regeneration + Protection + Comfort = survive and thrive
- **Heirloom Set:** Auto-Repair + high-level Enhancement = family treasures

**Budget Recommendations:**

- **Combat Essential:** Regeneration I (300c) - basic healing
- **Professional Soldier:** Regeneration II-III (1200c-5000c) - reliable recovery
- **Heirloom Investment:** Auto-Repair I (3000c) - item lasts centuries
- **Master Quality:** Both at Level III+ (10000c+) - ultimate durability and healing

**Economic Analysis:**

- **Regeneration:** Reduces healing potion costs, fewer healer visits, faster recovery
- **Auto-Repair:** Eliminates repair costs, item lasts generations, one-time investment
- **ROI Timeline:**
  - Regeneration pays back in 1-2 years (avoided healing costs)
  - Auto-Repair pays back in 5-10 years (avoided repairs), then provides centuries of value

**Special Considerations:**

- **Regeneration** doesn't replace instant healing (emergencies need potions/healers)
- **Auto-Repair** can't restore items destroyed beyond recognition
- Both work passively - no activation needed
- Anti-magic zones suspend effects temporarily
- Recharge frequency: Journeyman 3-7 years, Master 5-10 years or never

**Profession Applications:**

- **Adventurers:** Regeneration essential (300c minimum investment)
- **Soldiers:** Regeneration standard issue in advanced militaries
- **Master Craftspeople:** Auto-Repair on signature tools (lifetime investment)
- **Nobles:** Auto-Repair on family heirlooms (generational treasures)
- **Healers:** Regeneration for self-care (ironic but practical)
