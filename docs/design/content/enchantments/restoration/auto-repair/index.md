# Auto-Repair

## Lore

### Origin

Auto-Repair (also called Mending or Self-Restoration) represents one of the most sophisticated achievements in enchantment theory. The breakthrough came when a frustrated [Enchanter](../../classes/index.md) named Thora Everforge grew tired of adventurers returning with broken equipment. She studied how living things heal themselves and translated those principles into inanimate objects. The result was controversial - critics argued she'd given items a form of artificial life. Thora countered that she'd simply taught objects to "remember" their undamaged state and return to it.

The enchantment works by storing a magical "template" of the item in perfect condition. When damage occurs, the enchantment gradually reshapes the physical object to match the template, using ambient magical energy as fuel. Deep scratches fill in. Broken blades reforge themselves. Torn fabric reweaves. The process is slow but relentless - given enough time, even catastrophically damaged items restore themselves completely.

### In the World

Auto-Repair items are extraordinarily valuable and correspondingly rare. A sword that repairs itself means never worrying about finding a smith in hostile territory. Armor that mends overnight lets soldiers fight extended campaigns without supply lines. Even wealthy [Merchants](../../classes/index.md) prize Auto-Repair clothing - garments that never wear out no matter how much travel and adventure they endure.

The enchantment has created a small industry of "item keepers" - specialists who care for Auto-Repair artifacts. When an item is severely damaged, keepers place it in secure, magic-rich environments where it can heal faster. Some [Guildhalls](../../classes/index.md) maintain "healing chambers" for members' Auto-Repair equipment, charging modest fees for accelerated restoration. And every veteran adventurer has stories of their Auto-Repair blade saving their life after it pieced itself back together overnight following a devastating battle.

Auto-Repair works best on items with clear original forms.

### Stacking and Combos

- **With Unbreaking:** Perfect combination - rarely damages, repairs when it does (near-eternal items)
- **With Efficiency:** Tool works faster and fixes itself
- **With Fortune:** Expensive Fortune tools protected from wear
- **Multiple Auto-Repair Items:** Each repairs independently
- **Enhancement Stack:** Unbreaking + Auto-Repair + Efficiency = ultimate professional tool

### Limitations and Edge Cases

**Can Repair:**

- Cracks, chips, scratches
- Broken components (if pieces still exist)
- Worn edges and dull blades
- Torn fabric and leather
- Minor material loss (fills in slowly)

**Cannot Repair:**

- Completely missing pieces (can't regrow a lost sword blade)
- Fundamental alterations (can't "fix" intentional modifications)
- Magical corruption or curses
- Damage from anti-magic
- Fire/acid damage that completely destroys material

**Restoration Priority:**

1. Structural integrity (prevent complete failure)
2. Functional components (working parts first)
3. Cosmetic damage (scratches, dings last)

### Profession Applications

| Profession                                    | Value     | Typical Items                         |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| [Adventurers](../../classes/index.md)         | Essential | Weapons, armor (survival gear)        |
| [Soldiers](../../classes/index.md)            | High      | Combat equipment for campaigns        |
| [Remote Workers](../../classes/index.md)      | High      | Can't access repair services easily   |
| [Tool Professionals](../../classes/index.md)  | Good      | Tools last career with no maintenance |
| [Traveling Merchants](../../classes/index.md) | Moderate  | Containers and personal items         |
| [Performers](../../classes/index.md)          | Good      | Instruments that never need repair    |
| [Scholars](../../classes/index.md)            | Moderate  | Books and research equipment          |

### Economic Considerations

**Extreme Investment:**
Auto-Repair is one of the most expensive enchantments. Level I costs as much as a small house.

**Lifetime Savings:**
Never paying for repairs eventually recoups the cost. Break-even typically 5-10 years for working professionals.

**Resale Value:**
Auto-Repair items retain 80-95% of original value even after decades of use.

**Inheritance Wealth:**
Often appears in family heirlooms and noble estates. Auto-Repair + Unbreaking items can last centuries.

### Interactions

| System       | Interaction                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Durability   | Removes need for repair services            |
| Economy      | Massive upfront cost; zero maintenance cost |
| Combat       | Equipment survives any non-fatal damage     |
| Inheritance  | Items become eternal heirlooms              |
| Convenience  | Never worry about finding smiths/tailors    |
| Independence | Enables operation in remote/hostile areas   |
