# Regeneration

## Lore

### Origin

Regeneration enchantments represent the pinnacle of benevolent life magic - healing without the need for healers, recovery that continues as long as you wear the enchanted item. The enchantment was developed by battlefield medics during the Border Wars, desperate to help wounded soldiers survive long enough to reach proper healing. By weaving restorative magic into wearable items, they created a constant trickle of healing that, while slow, never ran dry.

The challenge with Regeneration is maintaining the delicate balance of life energy. Too aggressive and the magic burns out quickly or causes uncomfortable side effects - itching skin, excess hunger, accelerated aging. Too gentle and the healing is imperceptible. Master enchanters spend years learning to calibrate Regeneration to each item type and material, ensuring the flow of healing energy matches the wearer's natural vitality.

### In the World

Regeneration-enchanted items are luxuries that pay for themselves in survival. Adventurers treasure them for extending their time in dangerous places without healers. Soldiers in remote outposts rely on them when priests are scarce. Even wealthy merchants who travel dangerous roads invest in Regeneration - not for the daily scratches, but for the peace of mind knowing serious injuries will begin healing immediately.

The enchantment has spawned a peculiar profession: enchantment-healers. These specialists maintain Regeneration enchantments at hospitals and healing houses, ensuring the magical items lent to recovering patients maintain full potency. Some charitable organizations provide Regeneration-enchanted vests to elderly citizens and chronically ill individuals, allowing them greater independence. The famous Mercy Corps, battlefield medics operating in war zones, all wear Regeneration rings as a backup to their healing magic. Even common laborers save for a simple Regeneration ring - a small constant heal can prevent minor injuries from becoming major problems.

### Side Effects and Considerations

**Positive:**

- Increased appetite (body needs fuel for healing)
- Better sleep quality
- Faster recovery from illness
- Improved wound closure

**Manage Carefully:**

- High-level Regeneration requires increased caloric intake (2-3x normal)
- May heal broken bones incorrectly if not set properly
- Cannot regrow lost limbs (only mend damage)
- Foreign objects must be removed or body heals around them
- Overreliance may cause natural healing to atrophy
