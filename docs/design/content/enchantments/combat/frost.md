# Frost

## Lore

### Origin

Frost enchantments emerged from the frozen north, where ice-mages sought to capture winter's bite in more portable forms. The first frost-enchanted items were created by the Winterhold Academy, gifts to rangers and scouts who needed to survive in lands where fire attracts deadly attention. Unlike flame's aggression, frost is patient - it slows, it preserves, it endures.

The enchantment draws upon cold's dual nature: the sharp pain of frostbite and the peaceful stillness of deep winter. Master enchanters speak of "finding the quiet" when working frost magic - rushing the process results in brittle enchantments that shatter at the first strike. A proper Frost enchantment feels stable, eternal, like a glacier's heart translated into physical form.

### In the World

Frost items are prized by those who value control over raw destruction. A flaming sword announces your presence; a frost blade lets you dictate the pace of battle. City guards prefer frost-enchanted batons for subduing drunks without permanent harm - a few good whacks and the troublemaker's too sluggish to fight but not injured enough to die.

In hot climates, frost-enchanted items serve double duty. Desert traders carry frost daggers for protection and to cool their tents at night. Southern smiths discovered that frost blades make excellent tools for working certain metals that require cold treatment. Frost rings became popular among bakers and brewers who need to handle hot items - the chill provides perfect insulation. And every summer, wealthy nobles host "ice blade" demonstrations at garden parties, where warriors perform intricate routines while frost patterns bloom on practice targets.
