# Flaming

## Lore

### Origin

Fire was humanity's first tool and first weapon, so it's fitting that Flaming became one of the earliest successful combat enchantments. The breakthrough came during the Giant Wars, when enchanter-smiths sought ways to give human warriors advantages against much larger foes. A weapon wreathed in flame proved psychologically powerful - giants who'd shrugged off steel blades would hesitate before fire.

The enchantment's true elegance lies in its selectivity. The flames burn what the wielder wishes them to burn, leaving the wielder and their equipment untouched. This requires a delicate balance of fire essence and protective ward-work, making Flaming a journeyman's challenge rather than an apprentice's first project. Enchanters who rush the process create items that burn everything - including their owners.

### In the World

A flaming weapon is impossible to miss. Warriors bearing such weapons are instantly recognizable in battle, often becoming leaders through sheer visibility. Town guards in dangerous regions carry flaming swords as much for deterrence as combat - bandits think twice when they see fire in the darkness.

Beyond combat, Flaming items serve practical purposes. Explorers use them as reliable light sources in deep places. Forest wardens can clear brush while patrolling. Northern tribes enchant their weapons to provide warmth during harsh winter hunts. Enchanters discovered that Flaming rings or amulets can ignite campfires, light torches, or cook simple meals - practical applications that make the enchantment valuable even for non-combatants. In the annual Festival of Lights, warriors perform exhibitions with flaming blades, drawing oohs and ahhs from crowds who've never seen enchantment before.
