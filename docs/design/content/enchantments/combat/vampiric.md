# Vampiric

## Lore

### Origin

Vampiric enchantments walk the narrow line between useful magic and forbidden necromancy. They emerged during the Plague Years, when healers grew desperate to save patients who'd lost too much blood. A hedge-witch discovered that items could be enchanted to transfer vitality - not stealing life to empower the object, but using the item as a conduit to redirect life energy. The moral distinction matters to ethicists and courts of law, though victims rarely appreciate the difference.

The Enchanter's Guild debates Vampiric magic constantly. Traditionalists argue it's too close to dark magic, corrupting wielders with each use. Pragmatists point out that Vampiric items save lives by keeping warriors alive in battle. The compromise: Vampiric enchantments are legal but heavily regulated, requiring licenses and periodic inspections. Black market Vampiric items bypass these restrictions, often with dangerous side effects.

### In the World

Warriors carrying Vampiric items are recognizable by their appearance after battle - less exhausted than their comrades, wounds closing as they fight. This provokes mixed reactions. Allies appreciate having warriors who stay strong throughout extended combat. Enemies find it demoralizing to wound a foe who seems to heal from every exchange. Common folk view Vampiric items with unease, reminded too much of actual vampires.

Solo adventurers prize Vampiric enchantments for their survival value. In places where healing magic is scarce, a Vampiric blade might be the difference between completing a mission and dying in some forgotten dungeon. Gladiator rings ban Vampiric weapons as unsporting - the crowd wants to see warriors overcome injuries, not ignore them. And certain religious orders prohibit their [Paladins](../../classes/index.md) from using Vampiric enchantments, considering it theft of the spark divine.
