# Lightning

## Lore

### Origin

Lightning enchantments were born from storm-mages' attempts to harness thunderbolts - raw, chaotic power that destroys as readily as it protects. The breakthrough came when enchanters stopped trying to control lightning and instead learned to channel it. The item becomes a conduit, inviting electricity rather than containing it. This philosophical shift transformed lightning from a dangerous novelty into a reliable combat enchantment.

The first successful Lightning blade was created during a literal thunderstorm, and superstitious enchanters maintained that tradition for decades afterward. Modern enchanters know that storm conditions aren't required, but many still prefer to work Lightning enchantments during stormy weather. There's something fitting about calling lightning while rain pounds the workshop roof.

### In the World

Lightning items are spectacular in action - arcs of electricity leaping from item to target, the sharp crack of thunder, the smell of ozone. Young warriors dream of wielding such weapons, though veterans know the drawbacks. Lightning is loud, bright, and attracts attention. Every monster for miles knows you're coming when your sword sounds like a thunderclap with each strike.

Still, certain situations demand Lightning's unique properties. Metal-armored foes conduct the shock beautifully. Water-dwelling creatures have nowhere to hide from spreading electricity. And practitioners of magic find their concentration shattered by electrical disruption. Sky-ship marines favor Lightning weapons for boarding actions, where the noise doesn't matter and enemies cluster together perfectly for chain effects. Lightning rings have found surprising utility among signal-keepers and emergency responders - a bright flash and loud crack makes an excellent distress signal.
