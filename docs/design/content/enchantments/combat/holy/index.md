# Holy

## Lore

### Origin

Holy enchantments occupy a unique space between divine blessing and arcane technique. They cannot be learned from books alone - the enchanter must genuinely understand the divine principles they're channeling, whether through faith, scholarship, or lived experience. The Church of the Eternal Light maintains that Holy items are gifts from the gods, merely facilitated by mortal hands. Secular enchanters argue they're accessing a particular frequency of magical energy. Both groups produce working Holy enchantments, so perhaps the distinction matters less than the results.

The first Holy blade, Light's Promise, was crafted during the Demon Wars by a paladin-enchanter who prayed over his work for seven days and nights. When he finally struck steel to anvil, witnesses swear the hammer rang like a cathedral bell. Modern Holy enchantments are less dramatic in their creation, but no less sacred to those who understand their purpose.

### In the World

Holy items shine with gentle radiance, brighter than torchlight but never harsh. In the presence of undead or demonic corruption, that light intensifies to a brilliant glare. Temple guards carry Holy weapons as emblems of their faith and practical tools against darkness. Adventurers who delve into cursed places pray for access to Holy blades, knowing that sometimes the difference between life and death is whether your weapon can cut through supernatural evil.

The creation of Holy items is restricted in most realms. Churches typically maintain control over who receives such armaments, wary of Holy power being used for unholy purposes. A [Paladin](../../classes/index.md) who falls from grace will find their Holy blade's light fading, eventually becoming just mundane steel. Holy items reject unworthy wielders - a safeguard that makes them valuable but not dangerous if stolen.
