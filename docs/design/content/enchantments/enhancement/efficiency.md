# Efficiency

## Lore

### Origin

Efficiency was discovered by accident when a tired apprentice enchanter fell asleep at their workbench, their hand resting on a chisel. They woke to find they'd unconsciously channeled magic into the tool, and when they resumed work, the chisel moved through wood like butter. After documenting the pattern, Efficiency became one of the most commercially successful enchantments in history - every professional who uses tools daily wants one.

The enchantment doesn't make you stronger or the tool sharper; it reduces resistance. The pickaxe finds weaknesses in stone. The saw's teeth glide through grain. The needle passes through cloth with minimal friction. Master enchanters describe it as "teaching the tool to work with materials rather than against them." Efficiency is the enchantment that turns work into craft, letting artisans focus on precision rather than exhaustion.

### In the World

Walk into any workshop and you'll spot Efficiency-enchanted tools immediately - they're the ones in constant use, passed down through generations, worth more than the shop itself. [Miners](../../classes/index.md) save for months to buy an Efficiency pickaxe, knowing it'll double their ore yield through sheer speed. [Carpenters](../../classes/index.md) treasure Efficiency planes and saws. Even home crafters invest in Efficiency needles and scissors.

The enchantment has transformed industries. Logging camps clear forests in half the time. Quarries produce twice the stone. Tailoring shops fulfill orders faster. Some progressive [Guilds](../../classes/index.md) provide Efficiency tools to apprentices, arguing that reducing physical strain lets students focus on learning technique. The famous Ironforge Mines attribute their productivity not to worker exploitation but to every miner carrying Efficiency tools - "Happy miners with good tools beat miserable miners with whips."

### Economic Impact

**Individual Level:**

- Efficiency I tool pays for itself in ~2 weeks of professional use
- Higher tiers cost more but increase earnings proportionally
- Resale value remains high (used Efficiency tools sought after)

**Industry Level:**

- Logging camps: 50-100% productivity increase
- Mines: Output doubles with full Efficiency toolsets
- Workshops: Take more commissions, higher profit margins
- Farms: Finish seasonal work faster, reduce labor needs

### Stacking and Combos

- **With Fortune:** Stack well - work faster AND get more resources
- **With Unbreaking:** Perfect combination - fast tools that last
- **With Sharpness:** Great for cutting/carving tools
- **Multiple Tools:** Using multiple Efficiency tools compounds benefits

### Interactions

| System    | Interaction                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Gathering | Faster resource collection rates                    |
| Crafting  | Reduced crafting time per item                      |
| Stamina   | Less fatigue from prolonged tool use                |
| Quality   | Speed doesn't reduce output quality                 |
| Economy   | Increased income for tool-based professions         |
| Guild     | Some guilds require Efficiency tools for journeymen |

### Limitations

**Does Not:**

- Improve output quality (only speed)
- Make unskilled workers skilled (technique still matters)
- Work on broken tools (must be functional)
- Bypass material limits (can't saw through steel with wood saw)
- Eliminate fatigue (reduces it, doesn't remove)
