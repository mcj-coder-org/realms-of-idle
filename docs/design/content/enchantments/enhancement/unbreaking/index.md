# Unbreaking

## Lore

### Origin

Unbreaking emerged from simple frustration - a [Blacksmith](../../classes/index.md) tired of customers returning with broken tools during harvest season. He embedded strengthening magic into a hoe, expecting it to last twice as long. Instead, it lasted five years of daily use. Word spread, customers demanded Unbreaking on everything, and the smith spent the rest of his life enchanting tools instead of forging them.

The enchantment doesn't make items harder or tougher in the traditional sense. Instead, it spreads stress evenly across the entire object, preventing weak points from failing. A mundane axe breaks at the handle joint. An Unbreaking axe distributes impact force across shaft, head, and even the user's grip, so no single point takes fatal stress. Master enchanters call it "teaching the object to remember being whole."

### In the World

Unbreaking is the enchantment of practicality. It's not flashy - your sword doesn't glow, your armor doesn't shimmer - but it means your equipment survives the situations that destroy mundane gear. The adventurer's sword that's seen fifty dungeons. The farmer's plow that's worked the same field for three generations. The soldier's shield that's turned aside a hundred blows.

Professional [Guilds](../../classes/index.md) often gift Unbreaking tools to apprentices graduating to journeymen status. "Your first masterwork tool that won't break just because you're still learning" is a traditional journeyman gift. Some families keep Unbreaking heirlooms for centuries - the grandmother's needles, the great-grandfather's hammer, tools that become part of family identity. Enchanters joke that Unbreaking is terrible for business (items never need replacement) but excellent for reputation (everyone remembers the tool that lasted forever).

### Economic Considerations

**Long-term Value:**
Unbreaking items cost 2-4x normal price but last 5-15x longer, making them excellent investments.

**Heirloom Status:**
High-level Unbreaking items often become family heirlooms, passed through generations.

**Resale Value:**
Used Unbreaking items retain 70-90% of value (still plenty of life left).

**Business Model Impact:**

- Craftspeople initially resist (fewer repeat customers)
- Eventually embrace (reputation for quality)
- Higher profit margins justify lower volume

### Stacking and Combos

- **With Efficiency:** Tools work faster AND last longer (perfect combo)
- **With Fortune:** Expensive Fortune tools protected (wise investment)
- **With Sharpness:** Blades stay sharp longer before needing service
- **With Mending/Auto-repair:** Near-eternal items (self-healing durability)
- **Multiple Unbreaking Items:** Each item lasts; no special interaction

### Interactions

| System      | Interaction                                           |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Durability  | Dramatically extends item lifespan                    |
| Maintenance | Repairs less frequent and more effective              |
| Economy     | Higher upfront cost, lower lifetime cost              |
| Inheritance | Items last generations; become heirlooms              |
| Combat      | Equipment survives extended campaigns                 |
| Crafting    | Tools last entire career                              |
| Quality     | Even cheap items with Unbreaking outlast fine mundane |

### Edge Cases and Limitations

**Does:**

- Prevent normal wear and tear
- Reduce catastrophic failure chance
- Make fragile items practical (glass tools!)
- Work on composite items (all components reinforced)

**Does Not:**

- Make items invulnerable (just much more durable)
- Repair existing damage (see Auto-repair for that)
- Protect against extreme conditions beyond item's design (don't swim in lava with Unbreaking boots)
- Prevent loss or theft
- Make items sharper, more effective, or better quality

### Appraisal and Authentication

**How to Verify Unbreaking:**

- Stress test (item withstands abnormal force)
- Wear patterns (Unbreaking items age uniformly)
- Magical detection (enchantment signatures visible to [Appraisers](../../classes/index.md))
- Historical documentation (provenance records)

**Counterfeits:**
Fake "Unbreaking" items are common scams. Always buy from licensed enchanters or [Guild](../../classes/index.md)-certified merchants.
