# Sharpness

## Lore

### Origin

The Sharpness enchantment emerged from a simple need - tired smiths who grew weary of customers returning with complaints about dull blades. According to guild records, an apprentice enchanter named Lyra Keenblade (the name was later adopted, not inherited) discovered the pattern while attempting to preserve her mentor's favorite kitchen knife. The enchantment proved so practical that within a generation, every professional enchanter learned it.

Unlike flashier combat magic, Sharpness represents the enchanter's philosophy of enhancement rather than transformation. The item remains itself - same metal, same balance, same character - but the edge holds true through use that would dull any mundane tool. Master enchanters take pride in Sharpness work, viewing it as a test of subtlety and precision.

### In the World

Ask any soldier what enchantment they'd choose for their blade, and nine out of ten will say Sharpness. A flaming sword is impressive in battle, but a sharp sword is useful every day. Hunters appreciate weapons that cleanly take game without tearing meat. Woodcarvers treasure Sharpness-enchanted knives that glide through grain without catching.

The enchantment has become so popular that "sharp as magic" has entered common parlance. Farmers pay good coin to have their scythes enchanted before harvest season. Professional cooks consider Sharpness-enchanted knives essential tools, not luxuries. Even barbers in prosperous towns offer "the magic shave" - close, comfortable, and impossible to achieve with mundane razors.
