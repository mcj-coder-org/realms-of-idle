# Fortune

## Lore

### Origin

Fortune enchantments emerged from the intersection of divination magic and practical greed. Early prospectors, tired of missing valuable ore veins, hired seers to guide their picks. A clever enchanter realized they could embed that "lucky intuition" directly into tools, creating implements that naturally gravitated toward valuable materials. The first Fortune pickaxe found a diamond vein on its third swing, and the enchanter retired wealthy shortly after.

The magic behind Fortune is subtle - it doesn't create resources that aren't there, but reveals what would otherwise be missed. The Fortune hoe uncovers ancient coins while tilling. The Fortune axe notices the hollow tree containing wild beehives. The Fortune fishing rod snags the old boot with a gold ring inside. Critics call it "cheating." Practitioners call it "not being stupid."

### In the World

Fortune tools are the dreams of gatherers everywhere. [Miners](../../classes/index.md) mortgage their homes to buy Fortune pickaxes, knowing one good find pays for everything. [Herbalists](../../classes/index.md) with Fortune sickles consistently harvest rare ingredients others walk past. [Fishermen](../../classes/index.md) with Fortune rods catch prize fish while their neighbors catch seaweed.

The enchantment has sparked its share of disputes. Some mining companies require workers to use company-provided tools, fearing Fortune tools would lead to theft ("That diamond was in my assigned shaft!"). Fishing tournaments often ban Fortune rods as unsporting. Yet governments encourage Fortune agriculture tools, since increased crop yields mean fewer famines. The Gatherer's Guild maintains that Fortune doesn't replace skill - "It shows you the treasure; you still have to dig it up without breaking it."

### Economic Considerations

**Pricing Premium:**
Fortune enchantments cost 3-5x more than comparable Enhancement enchantments because they directly increase income.

**Banned/Restricted Contexts:**

- Most competitive fishing tournaments
- Some mining operations (to prevent disputes)
- Archaeological digs (considered cheating by scholars)
- Government-mandated foraging in protected areas

**Encouraged Contexts:**

- Agricultural use (food security)
- Resource-poor regions (economic development)
- Licensed treasure hunting
- Apprentice training (learn to recognize good finds)

### Stacking and Combos

- **With Efficiency:** Perfect combo - gather faster AND get more
- **With Unbreaking:** Fortune tools are expensive; protect investment
- **Multiple Fortune Items:** Effects stack additively (tool + ring + bag)
- **With Prospecting Spells:** Multiplies effectiveness dramatically

### Interactions

| System      | Interaction                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Gathering   | Increased resource quantity and quality           |
| Economy     | Dramatically increases gatherer income            |
| Exploration | Reveals hidden treasures and secret stashes       |
| Combat      | Improves enemy drop rates and loot quality        |
| Crafting    | More/better materials means better final products |
| Luck        | Synergizes with other luck-based systems          |

### Limitations

**Does Not:**

- Create resources that aren't there (can't mine gold from bare stone)
- Guarantee rare finds (increases chance, not certainty)
- Work in completely barren areas
- Override ownership (still theft if you find someone's hidden gold)
- Replace skill (must still properly harvest the resources)

### Side Effects

**Positive:**

- Users develop "intuition" for valuable finds
- Increased confidence and job satisfaction
- Higher income leads to better quality of life

**Manage Carefully:**

- Others may become jealous or accusatory
- Risk of over-reliance on Fortune (skill atrophies)
- Legal disputes over "who found what" in shared spaces
- Tool theft becomes major concern (very valuable)
