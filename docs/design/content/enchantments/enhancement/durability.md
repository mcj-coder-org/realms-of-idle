# Durability

## Lore

### Origin

Durability enchantments for clothing emerged from the same principles as [Unbreaking](unbreaking.md) enchantments for tools, but adapted for flexible fabrics. A [Tailor](../../classes/index.md) named Marta Threadstrong grew frustrated watching beautiful garments destroyed by daily wear. She modified tool-durability patterns to work with cloth, creating garments that lasted years instead of months despite constant use. Her breakthrough democratized quality clothing - even modest families could own garments lasting generations.

The enchantment reinforces fabric at the molecular level without adding stiffness or weight. Fibers resist breaking, seams hold under stress, and overall structure maintains integrity through countless wash cycles and years of use. Unlike Unbreaking which prevents catastrophic failure, Durability focuses on resisting gradual wear - the fraying, thinning, and degradation that makes clothing look shabby before it actually breaks. Master enchanters describe Durability as "teaching fabric to remember being new."

### In the World

Durability-enchanted clothing transformed wardrobes from consumable goods to lifetime investments. [Laborers](../../classes/index.md) buy one Durability work outfit instead of replacing mundane clothes seasonally. [Children](../../classes/index.md) wear Durability clothes that survive growth spurts and rough play to pass down to siblings. [Soldiers](../../classes/index.md) rely on Durability uniforms that endure campaign conditions without falling apart. Even the wealthy appreciate Durability for heirloom garments - wedding dresses, ceremonial robes, and family regalia lasting centuries.

The enchantment had unexpected environmental benefits. Less clothing waste means reduced textile production. Families need smaller wardrobes, requiring less storage space. The clothing industry shifted toward quality over quantity - fewer garments but better made. Some progressive [Guilds](../../classes/index.md) provide Durability uniforms to apprentices as sustainability initiatives. And every parent appreciates Durability children's clothes - one set survives the entire childhood and passes to the next child pristine.

### Economic Analysis

**Individual Investment:**

| Level | Initial Cost | Mundane Replacement Cost | Break-Even | Lifetime Savings |
| ----- | ------------ | ------------------------ | ---------- | ---------------- |
| None  | 5 copper     | 5 copper/year            | -          | -                |
| I     | 15 copper    | 15 copper (3 years)      | 3 years    | Modest           |
| II    | 45 copper    | 35 copper (7 years)      | 6 years    | Significant      |
| III   | 165 copper   | 75 copper (15 years)     | 11 years   | Major            |

**Example: Work Pants**

- Mundane: 8 copper, lasts 1 year, cost over 15 years = 120 copper
- Durability II: 48 copper, lasts 7+ years, cost over 15 years = 96 copper (20% savings)
- Durability III: 168 copper, lasts 15+ years, cost over 15 years = 168 copper (break-even at 15, savings beyond)

**Industry Impact:**

- Clothing production decreased 40% (less replacement need)
- Quality focus over quantity
- Repair services shifted to alterations
- Resale market thriving (used Durability clothes valuable)

### Environmental Benefits

**Resource Conservation:**

- 60-80% less textile production
- Reduced water usage (less manufacturing)
- Lower chemical discharge (fewer dyes, treatments)
- Decreased landfill waste

**Sustainability Impact:**

- Families need 1/3 the wardrobe space
- Moving easier (fewer clothes)
- Lower resource extraction for fibers
- Generational items reduce consumption culture

### Stacking and Combos

- **With Comfort:** Durable AND comfortable forever
- **With Cleanliness:** Never wears out, never gets dirty (ultimate wardrobe)
- **With Warmth/Cooling:** Climate-perfect clothing that lasts
- **With Unbreaking (tools/weapons):** Different enchantment but same principle
- **Full Perfect Wardrobe:** Durability + Cleanliness + Comfort = buy once, wear for life

### Limitations

**Does Not:**

- Repair existing damage (use Auto-Repair for that)
- Prevent all damage (extreme abuse still works)
- Make clothing indestructible (just very durable)
- Protect against intentional destruction (scissors still cut)
- Adjust size as wearers grow/shrink

**Maintenance:**

- Minimal required (that's the point)
- Recharge every 5-10 years for lower levels
- High levels may never need recharge in lifetime
- Physical damage should be repaired promptly

### Special Considerations

**Children's Clothing:**

- Durability II minimum recommended
- Survives rough play
- Passes to multiple siblings
- Adjustable clothing with Durability grows with child value

**Heirloom Items:**

- Durability IV-V for generational pieces
- Wedding dresses, ceremonial robes
- Family regalia
- Investment in family history

**Work Gear:**

- Durability II-III professional standard
- Pays for itself quickly
- Reduces replacement downtime
- Professional appearance maintained
