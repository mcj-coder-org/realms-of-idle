# Featherfall

## Lore

### Origin

Featherfall was born from a simple observation: birds wearing armor would never get off the ground, yet warriors in full plate need to climb ladders, scale walls, and occasionally survive falls. The enchantment applies constant gentle levitation, not enough to fly but sufficient to make the wearer feel lighter and fall slower. The first successful Featherfall armor saved a knight who fell from a castle wall during a siege - she floated down like a dandelion seed, landing unharmed to the amazement of both armies.

The enchantment's elegance lies in its passive nature. Unlike a spell that requires activation, Featherfall simply makes everything easier. Stairs become less tiring. Jumps reach farther. Falls become drifts. For those who wear protective gear daily, the reduced strain means arriving at destinations fresh rather than exhausted. Master enchanters joke that Featherfall doesn't make you lighter - it just convinces gravity to ease up.

### In the World

Any professional who wears heavy gear daily will tell you Featherfall is worth twice its cost. The enchantment doesn't just prevent fall damage; it makes life livable. Guards can patrol walls all day without back pain. Knights remain combat-effective after hours in the saddle. Adventurers exploring vertical dungeons climb with confidence, knowing a misstep won't be fatal.

The enchantment has practical applications beyond combat. Construction workers in dangerous cities use Featherfall harnesses when building tall structures. Window washers in wealthy districts wear Featherfall vests as insurance. Mountain guides in the northern ranges won't take clients into high peaks without basic Featherfall gear. And every skyship crew member wears at least a Featherfall belt - when you work hundreds of feet in the air, falling is an occupational hazard. Even merchants prize Featherfall rings for reducing the strain of carrying sample cases all day.

| [Skyship Crew](../../classes/index.md)         | Fall survival        | Belts, boots     |
| [Mountain Guides](../../classes/index.md)      | Climbing safety      | Full gear        |
| [Construction Workers](../../classes/index.md) | Building safety      | Harnesses, belts |

| [Explorers](../../classes/index.md)            | Vertical navigation  | Multiple items   |

### Limitations

**Does Not:**

- Grant actual flight or levitation control
- Reduce item's actual physical weight (only felt weight)
- Prevent damage from forced falls (push spells, etc. still hurt)
- Work if enchantment is suppressed by anti-magic
- Make you lighter for others trying to carry you

**Environmental Considerations:**

- Strong winds can blow slow-falling individuals off course
- Very high falls still take time to descend (hours for miles)
- Landing in water from great height still creates splash/waves
- Enemies learn to target Featherfall items in aerial combat
