# Weightless

## Lore

### Origin

Weightless enchantments were discovered independently by two groups: [Merchants](../../classes/index.md) seeking lighter cargo loads and [Soldiers](../../classes/index.md) needing to carry more equipment. The breakthrough came when an enchanter realized that weight is subjective - objects don't get lighter, but their gravitational pull can be reduced relative to their surroundings. A Weightless container doesn't change its contents' mass; it simply makes gravity "forget" to pull on them as hard.

The distinction between Weightless and Holding enchantments confuses novices. Holding expands interior space through dimensional magic. Weightless reduces gravitational effect. They achieve similar practical results (carrying more comfortably) through completely different mechanisms. Many premium containers use both enchantments - expanded space that weighs almost nothing regardless of contents.

### In the World

Weightless containers revolutionized logistics. Army supply trains carry ten times more provisions. [Merchants](../../classes/index.md) transport heavy goods without straining horses or themselves. [Adventurers](../../classes/index.md) pack full armor sets without back pain. Even elderly citizens use Weightless shopping bags, regaining mobility they'd lost to aging muscles.

The enchantment has unexpected social impacts. Weightless moving boxes let families relocate without hiring laborers, democratizing mobility. Weightless tool belts enable those with physical limitations to work trades previously denied them. Some progressive cities provide Weightless carts to disabled citizens, dramatically improving accessibility. The [Porter's Guild](../../classes/index.md) initially resisted Weightless containers (threatened their business) but eventually adapted, focusing on organization and care rather than raw hauling strength.

### Enchantment Levels

| Level | Weight Reduction | Max Load Benefit    | Container Weight | Material Cost |
| ----- | ---------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| I     | 50%              | 2x carry capacity   | Normal           | 250 copper    |
| II    | 75%              | 4x carry capacity   | -25%             | 1000 copper   |
| III   | 90%              | 10x carry capacity  | -50%             | 4000 copper   |

### Special Properties

| Property            | Effect                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Gravity Reduction   | Contents weigh fraction of normal amount    |
| Container Lightness | Container itself also weighs less           |
| Balance Maintained  | Weight distribution feels natural           |
| No Mass Change      | Items retain full mass for impacts/momentum |
| Overload Safe       | Can pack more without structural damage     |
| Instant Effect      | Weight reduces moment item enters container |

### Physics Implications

**Important Distinctions:**

- **Weight vs. Mass:** Items feel light but maintain full mass
- **Momentum:** Dropping Weightless bag of rocks still has impact force
- **Inertia:** Swinging Weightless mace still requires force to change direction
- **Falling:** Items fall normally when outside container

**Practical Effects:**

- Easy to carry heavy loads
- Difficult to throw Weightless contents accurately (feels light, flies like full weight)
- Combat applications limited (weapon feels light but strikes with full force if removed)

### Material Interactions

| Material                                    | Compatibility | Special Effect            |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| [Cloth](../../materials/cloth/index.md)     | Excellent     | Natural lightness synergy |
| [Leather](../../materials/leather/index.md) | Excellent     | Flexible, comfortable     |
| [Wood](../../materials/wood/index.md)       | Good          | Carts and chests          |
| [Metal](../../materials/metals/index.md)    | Fair          | Works but less elegantly  |
| [Silk](../../materials/cloth/index.md)      | Excellent     | Finest Weightless bags    |
| [Canvas](../../materials/cloth/index.md)    | Excellent     | Durable work bags         |

### Profession Applications

| Profession                                 | Value         | Typical Containers            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| [Merchants](../../classes/index.md)        | Essential     | Cargo chests, trade packs     |
| [Soldiers](../../classes/index.md)         | High          | Supply packs, ammo containers |
| [Miners](../../classes/index.md)           | High          | Ore sacks                     |
| [Adventurers](../../classes/index.md)      | High          | Backpacks, gear bags          |
| [Movers](../../classes/index.md)           | Essential     | Moving boxes, furniture wraps |
| [Farmers](../../classes/index.md)          | High          | Harvest sacks                 |
| [Builders](../../classes/index.md)         | Moderate      | Tool transport                |
| [Travelers](../../classes/index.md)        | High          | Luggage                       |
| [Elderly/Disabled](../../classes/index.md) | Life-changing | Shopping bags, daily items    |

### Economic Considerations

**Trade Impact:**

- Merchant caravans carry more per wagon
- Shipping costs reduced per item
- Heavy goods (ore, stone) become profitable to transport
- Remote regions more economically viable

**Labor Market:**

- Physical strength less critical for cargo jobs
- Accessibility increases for limited-mobility workers
- Porter profession shifts to organization/care rather than strength
- Construction materials easier to position

**Consumer Benefit:**

- Shopping easier (no strain carrying purchases home)
- Moving houses more affordable (DIY possible)
- Elderly maintain independence longer
- Accessibility dramatically improved

### Comparison to Similar Enchantments

| Enchantment        | Function                | Best For                    |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Weightless**     | Reduces felt weight     | Heavy items, bulk cargo     |
| **Holding**        | Expands interior space  | Volume-constrained storage  |
| **Featherfall**    | Reduces wearer's weight | Armor, personal encumbrance |
| **Burden** (curse) | Increases weight        | Opposite effect, punishment |

### Stacking and Combos

- **With Holding:** Expanded space that weighs almost nothing (premium combo)
- **With Preservation:** Heavy food supplies stay fresh and light
- **With Unbreaking:** Heavy-duty containers for industrial use
- **Multiple Weightless Items:** Each item's contents reduced independently

### Limitations

**Does Not:**

- Change actual mass (momentum, inertia unchanged)
- Work outside container (must be stored inside)
- Affect living creatures (they suffocate in sealed containers anyway)
- Make container float (just lighter, not levitating)
- Prevent theft (lighter items easier to steal!)

**Safety Concerns:**

- Overconfidence can lead to overloading
- Removing heavy item from container suddenly restores full weight
- Cargo shifting in Weightless wagon still dangerous
- Anti-magic zones restore full weight instantly (potentially dangerous)

### Interactions

| System        | Interaction                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Encumbrance   | Dramatically increases effective carry capacity        |
| Logistics     | Transforms shipping and trade economics                |
| Accessibility | Enables participation for limited-mobility individuals |
| Combat        | Limited (weight returns when items removed)            |
| Travel        | Long journeys more comfortable                         |
| Economy       | Reduces transport costs significantly                  |
