# Preservation

## Lore

### Origin

Preservation enchantments solve humanity's oldest problem: food spoils. Before refrigeration magic, before salting and smoking, people watched harvests rot while winter loomed. The first Preservation containers emerged from desperation - a [Hedge Witch](../../classes/index.md) in a failing village discovered that certain enchantments slowed time's passage for objects, keeping autumn vegetables fresh through winter. The village survived. The witch became a hero. And enchanters everywhere learned the pattern.

The enchantment creates a bubble of slowed time within the container. For items inside, hours pass as minutes, days as hours, months as weeks. Fresh bread stays warm and soft for days. Harvested herbs retain potency for years. Even delicate flowers remain vibrant indefinitely. The enchantment doesn't freeze time completely - that requires legendary-tier magic - but it slows decay to a near-standstill, giving perishables effectively unlimited shelf life.

### In the World

Every kitchen in prosperous homes has at least one Preservation container. [Merchants](../../classes/index.md) transport fresh fish hundreds of miles from coast to inland cities. [Apothecaries](../../classes/index.md) store rare herbs gathered across decades. [Inns](../../classes/index.md) keep signature dishes prepared and fresh, ready to serve instantly. The enchantment transformed food security - regions once vulnerable to famine now store surplus harvests for years.

Preservation has cultural impacts beyond mere practicality. Families preserve wedding cakes to share on anniversaries. [Herbalists](../../classes/index.md) maintain "living" ingredients collected by teachers generations ago. Some nobles keep entire meals from historic banquets, treating them as edible artifacts. And every tavern has stories about adventurers returning from year-long expeditions to find their Preservation pouches still containing fresh sandwiches from home.

### Special Use Cases

**Controlled Aging:**
Some Preservation containers can be "reversed" - speeding time instead of slowing it:

- Age wine/cheese rapidly
- Ferment foods quickly
- Compost acceleration
- Usually requires Level III+ with special modification

**Temperature Control:**

- Cold Preservation: Keeps items chilled (meats, dairy)
- Warm Preservation: Keeps meals hot (soups, bread)
- Neutral Preservation: Room temperature (grains, dried goods)

**Medical Applications:**

- Organ/blood preservation for healers
- Potion ingredient storage
- Preserved surgical supplies
- Emergency medical kits

### Stacking and Combos

- **With Holding:** Large amounts of fresh food in small space
- **With Weightless:** Perfect for traveling with provisions
- **With Sorting:** Organized pantry that never spoils
- **Multiple Containers:** Each preserves independently

### Economic Impact

**Food Security:**

- Famine risk dramatically reduced
- Surplus harvests stored years
- Seasonal foods available year-round
- Reduced food prices (less waste)

**Trade Revolution:**

- Fresh seafood available inland
- Exotic fruits shipped globally
- Prepared meals as trade goods
- Restaurant industry flourishes

**Household Budget:**

- Buy in bulk, no spoilage
- Meal prep for weeks
- Reduced food waste
- Long-term cost savings

### Limitations

**Does Not:**

- Stop all aging (just slows it dramatically)
- Improve food quality (preserves current state)
- Work on living creatures
- Prevent intentional consumption (items still accessible)
- Protect against mishandling outside container

**Maintenance:**

- Recharge every 1-5 years depending on use
- More effective if kept closed
- Opening temporarily weakens effect
- Heavy use degrades enchantment faster
