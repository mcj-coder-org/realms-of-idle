# Deep Pockets

## Lore

### Origin

Deep Pockets enchantments emerged when a [Tailor](../../classes/index.md) realized that Holding bag technology could be miniaturized and integrated directly into clothing. The first Deep Pockets coat let a merchant carry an entire day's inventory samples in normal-looking pockets - no visible bags, no obvious burden, just seemingly endless storage. The innovation transformed professional attire from restrictive uniforms into mobile warehouses.

The enchantment creates micro-dimensional spaces anchored to each pocket. From outside, the pocket appears normal depth. Inside, it extends into a small pocket dimension holding far more than physical size suggests. Unlike full Holding containers, Deep Pockets maintains the clothing's normal appearance - no bulging, no weight distribution issues, no obvious magic. Master enchanters describe Deep Pockets as "giving clothing a secret life."

### In the World

Deep Pockets-enchanted clothing is prized by anyone who needs to carry items discreetly or conveniently. [Merchants](../../classes/index.md) demonstrate products from seemingly empty pockets. [Thieves](../../classes/index.md) stash stolen goods without visible evidence. [Doctors](../../classes/index.md) carry complete medical kits in jacket pockets. [Parents](../../classes/index.md) have snacks, toys, and first aid always accessible. Even wealthy nobles appreciate Deep Pockets formal wear - elegance without sacrificing practicality.

The enchantment created new fashion possibilities. Formal wear can be functional. Work clothes carry professional tools invisibly. Travel clothing eliminates the need for obvious bags in dangerous areas. Some [Guilds](../../classes/index.md) provide Deep Pockets work clothes to craftspeople, letting them carry tools everywhere without bulky tool belts. And every spy appreciates Deep Pockets - items hidden where searches rarely find them.

### Concealment and Security

**Advantages:**

- Doesn't look like you're carrying much
- Hard to estimate what you have
- Searches often miss Deep Pockets (unless familiar with enchantment)
- No obvious target for thieves

**Security Concerns:**

- Guards familiar with Deep Pockets will check thoroughly
- Some jurisdictions require declaring Deep Pockets at checkpoints
- Items can be stolen from pockets if not secured
- Anti-magic zones expose hidden items suddenly

**Legal Restrictions:**

- Some regions limit Deep Pockets capacity (prevent smuggling)
- Must declare at customs in many kingdoms
- Banned in prisons and some government buildings
- Concealed weapon laws apply to Deep Pocket storage

### Economic Considerations

**Professional Investment:**

- Level II standard for working professionals
- Level III-IV for specialized needs
- Level V luxury but enables mobile business
- Typical ROI: 6 months (convenience and theft prevention)

**Industry Impacts:**

- Bag/luggage industry shifted to specialized gear
- Pickpocketing became less profitable (hard to spot targets)
- Security adapted to check for Deep Pockets
- Fashion integrated functionality seamlessly

### Stacking and Combos

- **With Holding Bags:** Pockets for quick access, bags for bulk storage
- **With Sorting:** Auto-organized pockets (think of item, hand finds it)
- **With Weightless:** Maximum capacity, minimum burden
- **Multiple Garments:** Each garment's pockets independent

### Comparison to Alternatives

| Storage Method     | Capacity   | Discretion         | Access Speed | Cost  |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ----- |
| Deep Pockets III   | 20x/pocket | Excellent          | Fast         | 3000c |
| Holding Bag II     | 10x total  | Poor (obvious bag) | Fast         | 2000c |
| Normal Pockets     | 1x         | Excellent          | Fast         | Free  |
| Backpack + Pockets | 15x total  | Poor               | Moderate     | 50c   |

### Limitations

**Does Not:**

- Store living creatures (they suffocate)
- Store extremely hot items (damages dimensional fabric)
- Store other dimensional items (interference)
- Work in anti-magic zones
- Prevent items from being stolen if pickpocketed

**Capacity Limits:**

- Individual items must fit through pocket opening (dimensional space inside, physical opening outside)
- Very large items still won't fit (can't store a sword through tiny pocket)
- Weight reduction not elimination (Level II at 75% reduction still feels 25% weight)

### Interactions

| System      | Interaction                                               |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inventory   | Greatly expands carrying capacity                         |
| Concealment | Items hidden from casual observation                      |
| Fashion     | Functionality doesn't sacrifice elegance                  |
| Professions | Mobile tool/inventory storage                             |
| Theft       | Both aids and complicates (concealment vs pocket-picking) |
| Travel      | Reduces need for obvious bags in dangerous areas          |

### Maintenance and Care

**Standard Upkeep:**

- Periodic recharge (every 2-3 years)
- Empty pockets before washing if possible
- Repair physical damage to prevent dimensional leaks
- Check for dimensional stability annually

**Signs of Failure:**

- Items harder to retrieve
- Weight reduction decreases
- Visible bulging when full
- Items occasionally "lost" (fallen into dimensional cracks)
