# Holding

## Lore

### Origin

Holding enchantments emerged from the eternal traveler's dilemma: needing more stuff than you can carry. The breakthrough came when a [Wizard](../../classes/index.md) studying dimensional theory realized that containers don't need to obey normal spatial rules. By creating a fold in space anchored to a container's interior, enchanters could make bags hold far more than their exterior suggested. The first Bag of Holding caused a sensation - a small pouch that held an entire camping kit.

The enchantment creates a pocket dimension accessible only through the container's opening. From outside, the bag appears normal. Inside, it's significantly larger - how much larger depends on the enchantment's power. The weight of stored items reduces proportionally to the space expansion, preventing users from being crushed by their own luggage. Critics worry about dimensional instability. Practitioners note they've been using Holding bags for centuries without incident.

### In the World

Holding containers are prized by anyone who travels or carries equipment regularly. [Merchants](../../classes/index.md) use Holding chests to transport more goods per wagon. [Adventurers](../../classes/index.md) pack entire arsenals into belt pouches. [Scholars](../../classes/index.md) carry personal libraries in shoulder bags. Even common laborers save for a Holding tool belt - being able to carry every tool without the weight burden transforms efficiency.

The enchantment has become so popular that "bigger on the inside" is a common saying meaning "surprisingly capacious." Some luxury markets offer Holding wardrobes and Holding pantries for wealthy homeowners. The [Merchant's Guild](../../classes/index.md) standardizes Holding containers - a Type II Holding bag carries approximately 10x normal capacity at 20% weight. Professional traders rely on these standards for inventory and shipping calculations.

- Interior: Small warehouse room
- Can hold: Merchant's entire inventory, furniture, large equipment
- Weight: Chest itself still weighs same; contents negligible

### Limitations and Restrictions

**Cannot Store:**

- Living creatures (they suffocate - dimensional space has limited air)
- Extremely hot items (damages dimensional fabric)
- Highly magical items (may interfere with enchantment)
- Other Holding containers (creates dangerous dimensional feedback)

**Safety Concerns:**

- Puncturing container spills contents into real space (explosive expansion)
- Anti-magic zones force contents out suddenly
- Overloading beyond capacity risks dimensional collapse
- Contents inaccessible if opening sealed/damaged

**Legal Restrictions:**

- High-level Holding containers (IV-V) require licenses in some kingdoms
- Customs inspections may forbid Holding luggage
- Some locations ban all dimensional magic
- Smuggling severe penalty when discovered

### Economic Considerations

**Initial Investment:**
Holding enchantments are expensive but pay for themselves:

- Level I: Affordable for working professionals
- Level II: Standard for merchants and adventurers
- Level III+: Luxury/specialized applications

**Shipping Revolution:**
Holding containers transformed trade economics:

- Merchant caravans carry 10x more goods
- Shipping costs reduced dramatically
- Enabled long-distance luxury goods trade
- Some economies dependent on Holding technology

**Rental Market:**
Many cities offer Holding container rentals for travelers and temporary needs.
