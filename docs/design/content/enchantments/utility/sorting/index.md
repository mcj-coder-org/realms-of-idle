# Sorting

## Lore

### Origin

Sorting enchantments emerged from exasperation rather than inspiration. A [Wizard](../../classes/index.md) named Marcus the Meticulous grew tired of pawing through his component pouch mid-spell, searching for the exact ingredient he needed. In frustration, he created an enchantment that organized his pouch automatically - items sorted themselves by type, and he could mentally request specific components. The spell component he needed would always be "on top," ready to grab.

The enchantment works through a form of limited intelligence. The container learns the owner's organizational preferences and maintains that system autonomously. Add items randomly? The container sorts them properly. Need something specific? Think about it, reach in, and find it waiting in your hand. Higher-tier Sorting even anticipates needs - the cook's knife appearing before they consciously think "I need to chop." It's not true consciousness, enchanters insist, just very sophisticated responsive magic.

### In the World

Sorting containers are beloved by anyone who handles many items professionally. [Cooks](../../classes/index.md) use Sorting spice racks where the right seasoning always comes to hand. [Crafters](../../classes/index.md) employ Sorting toolboxes - reach in thinking "needle-nose pliers" and you'll grasp them immediately. [Merchants](../../classes/index.md) stock Sorting warehouses where inventory never gets lost. [Scholars](../../classes/index.md) treasure Sorting libraries where requested books "leap" from shelves into waiting hands.

The enchantment has become status symbol - a mark of professional success. Apprentices dream of earning their first Sorting container upon graduation. Families pass down Sorting heirlooms, often cookware or craft boxes. Some [Guilds](../../classes/index.md) provide Sorting equipment to journeymen, viewing it as productivity investment that pays for itself. And every adventurer who's fumbled for healing potions while bleeding appreciates the party member with a Sorting bag who can produce needed items instantly.

### Use Case Examples

**Combat Scenario (Level III Backpack):**

- Think "healing potion" mid-fight
- Hand closes on correct potion instantly
- No fumbling, no inventory searching
- Potential life-saver

**Kitchen Scenario (Level IV Spice Rack):**

- Start making specific dish
- Reach for spice shelf
- Hand finds exact spice needed without looking
- Cooking becomes fluid, effortless

**Crafting Scenario (Level V Toolbox):**

- Begin project mentally
- Tools arrange themselves in project order
- Each step, needed tool waiting on top
- Work flows naturally, no interruptions

### Economic Considerations

**Productivity Gains:**

- Professionals work 20-40% faster (no searching time)
- Reduced errors (always grabbing correct item)
- Lower stress (organizational mental load eliminated)
- Improved quality (focus on work, not organization)

**Investment Return:**

- Level I-II: Pays for itself in months (time saved)
- Level III-IV: Essential for high-volume professionals
- Level V: Luxury but makes complex work manageable

**Market Demand:**

- Sorting containers highly sought after
- Strong resale market (retains 70-80% value)
- Common graduation/promotion gifts
- Guild standard equipment for many professions

### Stacking and Combos

- **With Holding:** Huge organized space that auto-sorts
- **With Preservation:** Sorted pantry where nothing spoils
- **With Weightless:** Light, organized cargo
- **Full Premium Combo:** Holding + Weightless + Sorting + Preservation = ultimate container

### Limitations

**Does Not:**

- Create items (only organizes what's there)
- Merge damaged items into whole ones
- Clean items (separate enchantment needed)
- Work without owner input initially (must learn preferences)
- Organize living creatures (wouldn't work anyway)

**Learning Period:**
Initial use requires:

- Adding items one category at a time
- Mentally noting preferred organization
- First week: basic sorting
- First month: preference learning
- After three months: fully adapted to owner

**Reset Concerns:**

- New owner must "retrain" the container
- Can be reset to default by enchanter
- Family heirlooms often keep previous owner's system
- Some users prefer inherited organization

### Interactions

| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Productivity  | Dramatically reduces time searching for items  |
| Inventory     | Always know what you have and where            |
| Combat        | Fast item access can be life-saving            |
| Crafting      | Smooth workflow, no interruption hunting tools |
| Mental Load   | Eliminates organizational stress               |
| Accessibility | Helpful for memory issues, visual impairments  |
