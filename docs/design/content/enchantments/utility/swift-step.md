# Swift Step

## Lore

### Origin

Swift Step enchantments emerged from courier culture, where speed meant livelihood. A [Messenger](../../classes/index.md) named Fleet Windrunner grew frustrated losing contracts to faster competitors. She commissioned an enchantment for her boots that would enhance her natural pace without exhausting her. The result let her cover distances 30% faster with no additional fatigue - suddenly she was the fastest courier in three provinces.

The enchantment works by optimizing every aspect of movement. Stride length increases naturally. Foot placement becomes instinctively efficient. Energy transfer from leg to ground maximizes with each step. It's not super speed - users don't blur or break physical laws - but rather perfect biomechanical efficiency combined with subtle magical enhancement. Master enchanters describe Swift Step as "teaching your body its ideal pace."

### In the World

Swift Step-enchanted footwear is ubiquitous among professionals who travel. [Couriers](../../classes/index.md) consider it essential equipment. [Guards](../../classes/index.md) patrol larger territories in the same time. [Merchants](../../classes/index.md) make more stops per day. [Adventurers](../../classes/index.md) reach dungeons before others and escape dangers more reliably. Even common citizens appreciate Swift Step boots for daily errands - chores that took half a day now finish in hours.

The enchantment transformed urban planning. Cities spread outward as Swift Step made longer commutes practical. Rural communities stayed connected despite distances. Trade routes opened that were previously too remote. Some [Guilds](../../classes/index.md) subsidize Swift Step boots for members, viewing faster travel as collective productivity gain. And every parent appreciates Swift Step children's shoes - little legs keep up with adult pace, reducing "carry me" complaints on family trips.

### Travel Time Savings

**Example: 20-Mile Journey**

| Swift Step Level | Time (Walking) | Time Saved | Fatigue  |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| None             | 7 hours        | -          | High     |
| Level I          | 6 hours        | 1 hour     | Moderate |
| Level II         | 5 hours        | 2 hours    | Low      |
| Level III        | 4.5 hours      | 2.5 hours  | Minimal  |
| Level V          | 3.5 hours      | 3.5 hours  | None     |

### Economic Considerations

**Courier Industry:**

- Swift Step I minimum for employment
- Level III standard for competitive rates
- Level V for premium express service
- Pays for itself in weeks (more deliveries per day)

**General Productivity:**

- Commuters arrive less tired, more productive
- Merchants make more sales calls per day
- Service workers cover more clients
- Overall economic output increases 10-20%

**Urban Planning:**

- Cities expand (Swift Step makes suburbs practical)
- Public transport less critical
- Walking becomes preferred transit
- Real estate values spread outward

### Combat Applications

**Tactical Advantages:**

- Faster positioning in battle
- Better kiting and retreats
- Chase fleeing enemies effectively
- Escape dangerous situations
- +Initiative in combat

**Limitations:**

- Not true super speed (can be outpaced by horses, spells)
- Doesn't improve attack speed (just positioning)
- Enemies may also have Swift Step
- Only helps movement, not reflexes

### Stacking and Combos

- **With Featherfall:** Fast AND light (perfect combo)
- **With Comfort:** Speed without foot pain
- **Multiple Leg Items:** Diminishing returns (boots + pants = ~110% instead of 130%)
- **With Haste Spells:** Effects multiply (magical synergy)

### Limitations

**Does Not:**

- Grant super speed (still human limits)
- Improve upper body movement
- Make you a better fighter (just faster positioning)
- Work without legs (obviously)
- Function in immobilization situations

**Cautions:**

- High speed on slippery surfaces still dangerous
- Collisions hurt more at higher speeds
- Must adjust to new pace (first day accidents common)
- Anti-magic zones return to normal speed suddenly

### Interactions

| System       | Interaction                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Travel       | Dramatically reduced journey times      |
| Stamina      | Cover more distance with less fatigue   |
| Productivity | More tasks completed per day            |
| Combat       | Better positioning, escape capability   |
| Economy      | Increased output for mobile professions |
| Urban Spread | Enables larger city footprints          |

### Adaptation Period

**First Day:**

- Everything feels weird
- Overestimate movement, bump into things
- Doorways come faster than expected
- Stairs require concentration

**First Week:**

- Body adjusts to new pace
- Muscle memory adapts
- Confident normal movement
- Still surprises occasionally

**After Month:**

- Completely natural
- Automatic adjustments
- Walking without enchantment feels sluggish
- Speed becomes new baseline
