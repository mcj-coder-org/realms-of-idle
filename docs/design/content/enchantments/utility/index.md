## Category Overview

**Primary Users:** Merchants, travelers, parents, craftspeople, anyone needing storage or mobility

**Most Popular:** Swift Step (universal appeal, affordable) and Holding (professional essential)

**Best Combinations:**

- **Ultimate Storage:** Holding + Weightless + Sorting = huge capacity, no weight, instant access (~5000c mid-levels)
- **Fast Travel:** Swift Step + Featherfall + Holding = speed, lightness, carry everything (~1000c Level II)
- **Merchant Essential:** Holding + Deep Pockets + Sorting = samples accessible, bulk storage, organized
- **Parent Survival:** Deep Pockets + Swift Step = kid supplies always on hand, keep up with children

**Storage Hierarchy:**

- **Deep Pockets** - Worn clothing, quick access, discrete (2-15+ pockets)
- **Holding** - Dedicated containers, bulk storage, larger items
- **Weightless** - Makes either feel like nothing
- **Sorting** - Makes any storage instantly organized

**Budget Recommendations:**

- **Tight Budget:** Swift Step I (25c) - universal mobility
- **Working Class:** Holding I (200c) + Swift Step II (100c) = 300c basics
- **Middle Class:** Holding II (800c) + Deep Pockets II (800c) = 1600c comfort
- **Professional:** Full Utility suite Level III = 10000c+ (pays for itself)

**Special Considerations:**

- **Holding containers** cannot be stored inside other Holding containers (dimensional instability)
- **Deep Pockets** capacity limits in some regions (anti-smuggling laws)
- **Sorting** requires learning period to adapt to owner's organizational preferences
- **Swift Step** adjustment period - first day feels weird, month to full adaptation
- **Preservation** variants - Cold (food), Warm (potions), Aging-Acceleration (cheese, wine)

**Legal Notes:**

- Deep Pockets may require declaration at checkpoints
- Dimensional storage items need customs declarations in many kingdoms
- Some jurisdictions limit maximum Holding capacity
