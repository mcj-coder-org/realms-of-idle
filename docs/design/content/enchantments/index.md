## Stacking Rules

### General Principles

1. **Same Enchantment Multiple Items:** Effects generally DON'T stack
   - Exception: Protection-type enchantments stack additively with caps
   - Example: Protection III armor + Protection II shield = Protection IV equivalent (capped at V)

2. **Different Enchantments:** Stack freely unless noted
   - Example: Flaming + Sharpness = sharp burning weapon

3. **Diminishing Returns:** Multiple similar effects on one item
   - Example: Swift Step boots + Swift Step pants = ~110% bonus instead of 130%

4. **Compatibility:** Most enchantments compatible unless logically exclusive
   - Incompatible: Warmth + Cooling (pick one)
   - Compatible: Cleanliness + Durability + Comfort (perfect wardrobe combo)

### Popular Combinations

**Perfect Wardrobe:**

- Durability + Cleanliness + Comfort = clothes that last forever, never get dirty, always feel perfect
- Cost: ~315c for Level II of each (excellent value)

**Ultimate Storage:**

- Holding + Weightless + Sorting = huge capacity, no weight, instant retrieval
- Cost: ~5000c for mid-levels (merchant essential)

**Professional Tool Set:**

- Efficiency + Fortune + Unbreaking = fast work, better yields, tools last forever
- Cost: ~4000c for Level III set (pays for itself quickly)

**Adventurer's Armor:**

- Protection + Regeneration + Comfort + Cleanliness = safe, healing, comfortable, clean
- Cost: ~2000c for balanced levels

**Combat Weapon:**

- Sharpness + Flaming + Unbreaking = never dulls, fire damage, never breaks
- Cost: ~12000c for high levels (heirloom weapon)

**Travel Essentials:**

- Swift Step + Featherfall + Holding = fast, light, carry everything
- Cost: ~1000c for Level II set

**Social Edge:**

- Presence + Cleanliness + Comfort = charismatic, immaculate, confident appearance
- Cost: ~1500c for Level II (merchant/diplomat standard)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I enchant items myself?**
A: Yes, if you have [Enchanting](../skills/index.md) skill at the appropriate tier. Otherwise, visit an [Enchanter](../classes/index.md).

**Q: What happens to enchantments when anti-magic is used?**
A: Enchantments suppress in anti-magic zones. Items return to mundane state until magic returns.

**Q: Can enchantments be removed?**
A: Yes, through disenchanting. Process destroys the enchantment but may recover some reagents.

**Q: How many enchantments can one item hold?**
A: Theoretically unlimited, but practical limit is 3-4 before magical interference occurs. Cost also becomes prohibitive.

**Q: Do enchantments transfer when items break?**
A: No. If an item is destroyed, enchantments are lost. This is why Unbreaking/Durability are valuable.

**Q: Can I upgrade an enchantment level?**
A: Yes. Either reapply at higher level (pays difference) or have an enchanter upgrade existing enchantment.

**Q: Why are some items listed at different effectiveness percentages?**
A: Enchantment effectiveness depends on item type. A ring of sharpness makes no sense (no edge), but a ring of featherfall works at 70% effectiveness.

**Q: What's the difference between Unbreaking and Durability?**
A: Unbreaking is for tools/weapons (prevents catastrophic failure). Durability is for clothing/fabrics (prevents gradual wear). Both extend lifespan.

**Q: Is Presence considered mind control?**
A: No. Presence amplifies natural charisma but doesn't control free will. People still make their own decisions. Some jurisdictions regulate it anyway.

**Q: What's better: one high-level enchantment or multiple low-level ones?**
A: Depends on needs. High-level gives powerful single effect. Multiple low-level provides versatility. Most people use mixed approach.
