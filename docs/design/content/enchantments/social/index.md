## Category Overview

**Primary Users:** Merchants, diplomats, performers, politicians, leaders, salespeople

**Controversy:** Social enchantments spark ethical debates about fairness and manipulation.

**How Presence Works:**

- Amplifies natural charisma (+10% to +50% depending on level)
- Makes first impressions more positive
- Increases memorability in favorable way
- Projects confidence that inspires trust
- Draws attention naturally
- Grants benefit of doubt in social situations
- **NOT mind control** - doesn't override free will or force decisions

**Social Bonuses by Context:**

- **Negotiations:** Better deals, easier compromises
- **Performances:** Audience captivation beyond technical skill
- **Job Interviews:** Favorable impressions, trust building
- **First Meetings:** Instant rapport, welcoming responses
- **Public Speaking:** Audience engagement, message retention
- **Sales:** Higher close rates, customer loyalty
- **Leadership:** Inspired followers, loyal supporters
- **Romance:** Initial attraction (but can't create feelings not there)
- **Diplomacy:** Cultural barriers softened, goodwill generated

**Effectiveness by Level:**

- **Level I (+10%):** Noticeable positive lean, costs 300c
- **Level II (+20%):** Strong positive impression, costs 1200c
- **Level III (+30%):** Very favorable, unforgettable, costs 4500c
- **Level IV (+40%):** Exceptional, legendary status, costs 15000c
- **Level V (+50%):** Overwhelming, historic impact, costs 60000c

**Best Combinations:**

- **Social Edge:** Presence + Cleanliness + Comfort = charismatic, immaculate, confident appearance (~1500c Level II)
- **Professional Power:** Presence + Deep Pockets + Swift Step = influential, prepared, responsive
- **Performance Peak:** Presence + Comfort = captivate while feeling great
- **Diplomatic Suite:** Presence + multiple items for stacking effect

**Stacking:**

- Effects stack across multiple items (ring + necklace + cloak)
- Maximum cap: +100% charisma bonus regardless of items worn
- Example: 3 Level II items (20% each) = +60% total, not +60%

**Legal and Ethical Considerations:**

**Acceptable Uses (Guild Approved):**

- Professional advancement through fair self-presentation
- Overcoming unfair initial bias
- Public speaking confidence
- Cultural bridge-building
- Entertainment enhancement

**Questionable Uses (Legal but Debated):**

- Sales persuasion
- Political campaigning
- Romantic pursuit
- Job interviews

**Prohibited Uses (Illegal in Most Realms):**

- Combined with mind control magic
- Court testimony (considered perjury assistance)
- Fraud and deception
- Seduction without genuine consent intent
- Exploiting vulnerable populations

**Legal Requirements:**

- Must declare in formal contracts (some jurisdictions)
- Banned in courtrooms and legal proceedings
- Required disclosure for political candidates (some regions)
- Permitted in entertainment (venue disclosure)

**Detection and Limitations:**

- Skilled Appraisers can detect enchantment
- Strong-willed people have natural resistance
- Multiple interactions reveal genuine character
- Behavior must match impression or enchantment fails
- Magical detection spells identify Presence easily
- Doesn't work through remote communication (letters, scrying)
- Can't create competence where none exists
- Won't override strong negative impressions

**Budget Recommendations:**

- **Sales Professional:** Presence I (300c) - immediate ROI through better deals
