# Presence

## Lore

### Origin

Presence enchantments emerged from diplomatic necessity when words alone couldn't bridge cultural divides. An [Ambassador](../../classes/index.md) named Sera Silvertongue commissioned an enchantment to help her negotiate with hostile nations. The resulting magic didn't control minds or alter personalities - it simply made people want to listen, to engage, to consider her perspective fairly. By amplifying natural charisma and making the wearer memorable in positive ways, Presence enchantments became essential tools for anyone whose livelihood depends on social interaction.

The enchantment works through subtle influence magic - not mind control, but gentle suggestion that the wearer is worth attention. People find themselves drawn to Presence-enchanted individuals, remembering them fondly, giving them benefit of doubt. It's the magical equivalent of perfect lighting, ideal framing, and excellent timing all working in the wearer's favor. Master enchanters describe Presence as "teaching the world to notice you kindly."

### In the World

Presence-enchanted clothing is the secret weapon of successful socialites, merchants, and leaders. [Merchants](../../classes/index.md) wearing Presence-enchanted vests close deals that seemed impossible. [Performers](../../classes/index.md) in Presence-enchanted costumes captivate audiences beyond their technical skill. [Politicians](../../classes/index.md) donning Presence-enchanted formal wear win hearts and votes. Even shy individuals find Presence enchantments give them confidence - people respond so positively that genuine social skills develop naturally.

The enchantment sparked debate about ethics. Does influencing others' perceptions constitute manipulation? The [Enchanter's Guild](../../classes/index.md) maintains that Presence merely helps overcome initial bias, presenting the wearer's genuine qualities without interference. Critics argue it creates unfair advantages. Most accept it as simply another tool - like good grooming or eloquent speech - that helps people succeed socially. And many note that unlikable people wearing Presence still face consequences for poor behavior; the enchantment opens doors but can't keep them open.

### Ethical Considerations

**Acceptable Uses (Guild Approved):**

- Professional advancement through fair presentation
- Overcoming unfair initial bias
- Public speaking confidence
- Cultural bridge-building
- Entertainment enhancement

**Questionable Uses (Legal but Debated):**

- Sales persuasion
- Political campaigning
- Romantic pursuit
- Job interviews (competence still required)

**Prohibited Uses (Illegal in Most Realms):**

- Combined with mind control magic
- Court testimony (considered perjury assistance)
- Fraud and deception
- Seduction without genuine consent intent
- Exploiting vulnerable populations

### Limitations and Transparency

**Does Not:**

- Control minds or alter free will
- Create competence where none exists
- Force romantic feelings (only initial attraction)
- Work through remote communication (letters, scrying)
- Override strong negative impressions
- Guarantee outcomes (people can still disagree)

**Detection:**

- Skilled [Appraisers](../../classes/index.md) can detect enchantment
- Some people have natural resistance (strong-willed)
- Multiple interactions may reveal genuine character
- Behavior must match impression (or enchantment fails)
- Magical detection spells identify Presence easily

**Legal Requirements:**

- Must be declared in formal contracts (some jurisdictions)
- Banned in courtrooms and legal proceedings
- Required disclosure for political candidates (some regions)
- Permitted in entertainment (disclosed to venues)

### Stacking and Combos

- **With Cleanliness:** Immaculate appearance + magnetic presence
- **With Comfort:** Confident bearing from true comfort
- **Multiple Presence Items:** Effects stack (wearing ring + necklace + cloak)
- **Cap:** Maximum +100% charisma bonus regardless of items worn

### Profession Case Studies

**Merchant Success:**
Wearing Presence II vest: 30% increase in deal closure, 25% better terms, customers return specifically to them.

**Performer Impact:**
Presence III costume: Sold-out shows, critical acclaim beyond technical skill, fan devotion.

**Diplomat Effectiveness:**
Presence IV formal wear: Treaties negotiated in weeks instead of months, hostile parties find common ground.

**Political Advantage:**
Presence V regalia: Historical elections won, movements inspired, speeches remembered for generations.

### Side Effects
