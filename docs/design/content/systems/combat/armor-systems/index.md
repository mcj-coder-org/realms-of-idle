# Armor Systems

## Armor Philosophy

Armor exists on a fundamental spectrum: protection vs. mobility. Different armor types make different tradeoffs between these principles, with light armor prioritizing mobility and heavy armor prioritizing protection.

### The Protection Absolute (Heavy Armor)

Heavy armor warriors embrace a fundamental tactical principle: they will be hit. Rather than avoiding strikes through mobility or accepting wounds as survival cost, heavy armor simply stops strikes. The comprehensive protection transforms warriors into battlefield anchors - positions held, attacks absorbed, fear ignored through sheer imperviousness to harm that would kill lighter-armored fighters.

**Tactical Immobility:** Heavy armor accepts mobility sacrifice as necessary trade for protection. Warriors wearing full plate won't chase fleeing enemies, won't climb walls gracefully, won't swim rivers. They don't need to. Their role involves standing ground, holding positions, breaking enemy charges through immovable presence.

### The Evasion Principle (Light Armor)

Light armor warriors accept different tactical constraints: they must not be hit. Rather than stopping strikes, light armor prioritizes mobility to avoid strikes entirely. Warriors move freely, react quickly, position strategically to present minimal target surface. Armor provides backup protection for inevitable hits, but primary strategy relies on not being there when enemies strike.

### The Compromise (Medium Armor)

Medium armor attempts balance between protection and mobility, sacrificing superiority in both categories for competence in each. Most professional soldiers wear medium armor - sufficient protection for battlefield survival combined with enough mobility for tactical response.

## Armor Weight Classes

### Light Armor (10-20 lbs)

- **Protection**: Basic defensive benefit
- **Mobility**: Excellent, minimal penalties
- **Stealth**: Good, suitable for quiet movement
- **Special**: Swimming/climbing possible
- **Examples**: Leather, Padded, Hide, Studded

**Core Advantages:**

- Freedom of movement
- Suitable for stealth and mobility
- Minimal encumbrance penalties
- Easy to don/remove
- Comfortable for extended wear

**Core Limitations:**

- Lower protection vs heavy strikes
- Requires skill in positioning/evasion
- Provides psychological vulnerability
- Less intimidating presence

### Medium Armor (30-50 lbs)

- **Protection**: Moderate defensive benefit
- **Mobility**: Acceptable, notable penalties
- **Stealth**: Poor, armor noise
- **Special**: Swimming very difficult
- **Examples**: Breastplate, Chain Shirt, Scale Mail, Reinforced Leather

**Core Advantages:**

- Balanced protection and mobility
- Professional soldier standard
- Psychological benefit vs enemies
- Maintains reasonable speed
- Suitable for prolonged combat

**Core Limitations:**

- Weight causes fatigue over time
- Noise reduces stealth capability
- Maintenance required
- Cost is significant
- Not specialized in any role

### Heavy Armor (40-80 lbs)

- **Protection**: Maximum defensive benefit
- **Mobility**: Severe penalties
- **Stealth**: Impossible
- **Special**: Swimming impossible without removal
- **Examples**: Splint Mail, Plate Armor, Full Helms

**Core Advantages:**

- Maximum protection available
- Comprehensive coverage
- Fear factor/intimidation
- Status symbol
- Battlefield presence commands respect
- Nearly invulnerable to common strikes
- Survives focused enemy attacks

**Core Limitations:**

- Extreme weight causes exhaustion
- Significant speed and flexibility penalties
- Extraordinary cost (equivalent to houses)
- Constant maintenance required
- Completely unsuitable for stealth
- Overheating in hot climates
- Training required for combat effectiveness
- Requires assistance to don/remove

## Armor Progression Paths

### Light to Medium Progression

```
Leather (Basic) → Studded Leather (Apprentice)
  → Breastplate (Journeyman) → Chain Shirt (Journeyman)
    → Scale Mail (Master)
```

### Medium to Heavy Progression

```
Breastplate (Journeyman) → Splint Mail (Master)
  → Plate Armor (Master/Legendary)
```

### Specialized Armor Variants

- **Reinforced Leather**: Leather + protection upgrades
- **Hide Armor**: Beast-derived protection
- **Padded Armor**: Layered cloth for mobility
- **Ceremonial Armor**: Status/religious function

## Economic Impact

Armor represents significant financial investment:

- Light armor: 10-50 gold (affordable, common)
- Medium armor: 50-500 gold (professional soldiers)
- Heavy armor: 500-3000+ gold (knights, nobility)

Societies that field heavy armor warriors demonstrate serious military commitment and economic capacity. Individual warriors wearing heavy armor announce status, resources, and dedication to combat profession.

## Maintenance & Durability

| Armor Type | Durability   | Maintenance       | Repair Cost |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ----------- |
| Light      | 50-150 hits  | Basic cleaning    | 1-5 gold    |
| Medium     | 100-300 hits | Regular oiling    | 5-25 gold   |
| Heavy      | 200-500 hits | Daily maintenance | 50-250 gold |

## Environmental Considerations

### Hot Climates

- Light: Excellent (minimal heat)
- Medium: Acceptable (moderate heat buildup)
- Heavy: Severe overheating (dangerous for extended wear)

### Water/Moisture

- Light: No special consideration
- Medium: Water adds temporary weight
- Heavy: Swimming impossible, must remove or drown

### Cold Climates

- Light: Minimal insulation
- Medium: Good insulation
- Heavy: Excellent insulation but weight causes fatigue

## Training Requirements

| Armor Type | Training Time | Proficiency Level         | Combat Penalty        |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Light      | 1-5 hours     | Basic proficiency easy    | -5% without training  |
| Medium     | 10-40 hours   | Professional level needed | -15% without training |
| Heavy      | 40-200+ hours | Expert level required     | -30% without training |
