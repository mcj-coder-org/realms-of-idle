# Steel

## Lore

### Origin

Steel is iron perfected. By removing impurities and adding precise amounts of carbon, smiths create metal that holds a sharper edge, resists corrosion, and withstands greater stress than iron alone. The secret of steel production was closely guarded for centuries - smiths who knew the technique became wealthy and powerful.

### In the World

Steel weapons cost three times as much as iron but last five times longer. Warriors who can afford steel swords prefer them - they hold an edge through battles, don't rust as quickly, and can pierce iron armor. Steel tools work harder and fail less often. The difference between iron and steel is the difference between adequate and exceptional.

Creating steel requires precise temperature control, careful carbon addition, and multiple folding and refining steps. Only journeymen smiths attempt steel production, and even then, failure rates are high. A failed steel batch becomes wrought iron or scrap - an expensive lesson.
