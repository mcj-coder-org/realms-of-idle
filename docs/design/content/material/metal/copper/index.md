# Copper

## Lore

### Origin

Copper was one of the first metals worked by civilized folk. Soft enough to shape with stone tools but hard enough to hold an edge, copper marked humanity's transition from the Stone Age. Ancient smiths learned that hammering copper made it harder - the first step toward understanding metallurgy.

### In the World

Every apprentice blacksmith begins with copper. It's forgiving - mistakes can be melted down and tried again. Villages use copper for everything from nails to cookware to decoration. The distinctive pink-orange metal gleams on rooftops, temple fittings, and jewelry. Copper deposits are widespread near the surface, making them accessible to new miners.
