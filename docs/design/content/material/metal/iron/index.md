# Iron

## Lore

### Origin

Iron changed everything. Where copper bent and bronze chipped, iron held. Iron weapons outperformed bronze, iron armor protected better, and iron tools worked longer. The discovery of iron smelting marked the end of the Bronze Age and the beginning of true civilization. Dwarves claim they taught ironworking to humans; humans claim independent discovery; in truth, iron was discovered independently many times.

### In the World

Iron is the workhorse metal. affordable enough for common tools, strong enough for weapons and armor. Every smithy has iron ingots stacked by the forge. Every village relies on iron nails, hinges, fittings, and tools. Warriors carry iron swords into battle, farmers use iron plows, and builders trust iron brackets to hold roofs aloft.

Iron requires higher temperatures than copper to smelt and forge, meaning coal fires and proper bellows are essential. Apprentice smiths graduate from copper to iron as their skills improve - the transition marks their emergence as true craftsmen.
