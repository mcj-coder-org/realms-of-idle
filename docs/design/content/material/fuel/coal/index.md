# Coal

## Lore

### Origin

Coal burns hotter and longer than wood. This simple fact revolutionized metalworking. Where wood fires could only produce copper, coal fires produced iron. Where charcoal was expensive and inconsistent, coal was abundant and reliable. Coal mining created new industries, powered new forges, and enabled new technologies.

### In the World

Every forge runs on coal. Every smith keeps a supply near the hearth. Coal smoke billows from smithy chimneys, marking the location of craftsmen in every settlement. Miners find coal in the same shafts where they find iron - convenient, since both are needed for smithing.

Coal is heavy and dirty, but essential. Without coal, smelting stops. Without smelting, metalworking stops. Without metalworking, civilization stops. The blacksmith's fire is civilization's hearth.
