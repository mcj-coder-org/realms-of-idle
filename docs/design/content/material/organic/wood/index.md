# Wood

## Lore

### Origin

Before metal, there was wood. The first tools were wooden clubs and sharpened sticks. The first weapons were wooden spears. Even today, with all the wonders of metalworking, wood remains essential. Sword hilts, axe handles, tool shafts - metal is useless without wooden components to provide grip, balance, and flexibility.

### In the World

Every smith keeps a supply of wooden shafts and handles. Every weapon needs a grip. Every tool needs a shaft. Wood provides the flexibility that metal lacks - an iron axe head is useless without a wooden handle that absorbs shock. A sword needs a wooden grip wrapped in leather.

Different woods serve different purposes. Ash is flexible and resilient - perfect for axe handles. Oak is strong and stable - ideal for tool shafts. Yew bends without breaking - the traditional choice for bows. Lumberjacks learn to select the right wood for each job, reading grain and density with experienced eyes.
