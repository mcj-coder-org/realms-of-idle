# Leather

## Lore

### Origin

Leather is one of humanity's oldest materials - every culture has tanned hides since before recorded history. The process preserves animal skins, transforming them from perishable remains into durable material. Early tanners used plant tannins, smoke, and oils; modern tanners use refined techniques for consistent quality.

### In the World

Leather is everywhere. Belts, boots, bags, armor, scabbards, handles - the list is endless. Every villager owns leather items. Unlike metal, leather doesn't rust or corrode. Unlike cloth, leather doesn't tear easily. A good leather piece lasts decades with proper care.

Hunters process kills immediately, learning to skin and tan as part of their trade. Tanners buy hides, salt them, treat them, and sell the finished leather to crafters. The smell of a tannery is unmistakable - sharp, earthy, lingering.
