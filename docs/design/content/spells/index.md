# Spells Library

Spells are learned through training, study, or level-up awards. All spells belong to one of seven schools and progress through tiers.

## Structure

Spells are organized by school with tier-based progression:

- **School Organization**: Spells in directories by school (`/destruction/`, `/restoration/`, etc.)
- **Tier Progression**: Lesser → Greater → Enhanced (see [Spell Tiers](spell-tiers.md))
- **Learning Methods**: Spellbook study, trainer, or level-up award
