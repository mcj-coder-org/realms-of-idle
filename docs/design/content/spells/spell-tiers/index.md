# Spell Tiers

All spells progress through three tiers, increasing in power and mana cost.

## Tier Progression

| Tier     | Power Level      | Mana Cost | Typical Unlock      |
| -------- | ---------------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| Lesser   | Base effect      | Low       | Novice training     |
| Greater  | +50-75% effect   | Moderate  | Apprentice training |
| Enhanced | +100-150% effect | High      | Journeyman training |

## Tier Scaling

Each tier typically provides:

### Lesser

- Base damage/healing/duration
- Standard cast time
- Basic targeting (single target or small area)

### Greater

- Increased damage/healing/duration
- Improved targeting (larger area or multiple targets)
- Reduced cast time or added effect

### Enhanced

- Maximum damage/healing/duration
- Best targeting options
- Additional effects (DoT, debuff, buff stacking)
- Fastest cast time

## Learning Higher Tiers

| Method          | Requirement                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Level-up award  | Sufficient class level                     |
| Trainer         | Pay gold + have prerequisite tier          |
| Spellbook study | Have book + study time + prerequisite tier |
