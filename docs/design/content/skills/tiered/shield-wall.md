## Mechanics

**Trigger Actions:** Block attacks with shield, protect allies, shield bash

**Adjacent Protection:** At Greater tier and above, successful blocks extend protection to adjacent allies in the direction of the attack.

**Reflect Chance:** Enhanced tier grants a chance to reflect projectiles and magical attacks back at the attacker.

**Cooldowns:** Adjacent protection has no cooldown but can only affect one ally per block at Greater tier, all adjacent at Enhanced tier.
