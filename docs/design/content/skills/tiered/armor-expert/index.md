# Armor Expert

## Overview

Improved heavy armor usage that reduces movement and stamina penalties while increasing armor effectiveness and durability.

## Synergy Classes

**Strong Synergy (2x XP)**: Warrior, Knight, Guard

Classes with strong synergies get faster learning, better effectiveness, and lower costs.

## Tiers

| Tier     | Effect                                                                 | Scaling                |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Lesser   | -25% armor penalties (speed, stamina)                                  | +1% per class level    |
| Greater  | -50% armor penalties, +10% armor effectiveness                         | +0.75% per class level |
| Enhanced | -75% armor penalties, +20% effectiveness, armor repairs slower degrade | +0.5% per class level  |

## XP Progression

**XP Sources**:

- Fight in heavy armor: 3-8 XP per combat
- Take hits while armored: 2-5 XP per hit absorbed
- Extended wear: 1-3 XP per hour actively moving in armor
- Guided training: 10-100 XP per session
- Unguided training: 5-50 XP per session

**Level-Up Availability Thresholds**:

- Strong synergy classes: ~500 XP (~50 actions)
- Moderate synergy classes: ~1000 XP (~75 actions)
- No synergy classes: ~1500 XP (~100-150 actions)

## Synergy Bonuses

**Strong Synergy Example** (Knight Level 15):

- Faster learning: 2x XP from armored combat
- Better effectiveness: +25% armor penalty reduction
- Reduced cost: -25% stamina drain while armored

**Scaling with Class Level**:

| Class Level | XP Multiplier | Effectiveness | Cost Reduction |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Level 5     | 1.5x (+50%)   | +15%          | -15%           |
| Level 15    | 2.0x (+100%)  | +25%          | -25%           |
| Level 30+   | 2.5x (+150%)  | +35%          | -35%           |

## Mechanics

**Trigger Actions:** Fight in heavy armor, take hits while armored

**Armor Penalties:** Heavy armor typically imposes penalties to movement speed and stamina consumption. This skill reduces those penalties.

**Armor Effectiveness:** Greater and Enhanced tiers increase the actual protective value of armor beyond its base statistics.

**Repair Durability:** Enhanced tier causes armor to degrade slower during repairs, meaning fewer materials needed for maintenance.

**Armor Types:** Applies to heavy armor categories (plate, scale, chainmail). Medium armor receives half benefit. Light armor receives minimal benefit.
