# Commander's Voice

## Overview

Combat orders affect more allies at greater range with improved compliance, faster execution, and persistence through adverse conditions.

## Synergy Classes

**Strong Synergy (2x XP)**: Knight, Guard, Leader, Chieftain

Classes with strong synergies get faster learning, better effectiveness, and lower costs.

## Tiers

| Tier     | Range    | Compliance Bonus | Additional                           |
| -------- | -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Lesser   | Medium   | +15%             | Orders execute faster                |
| Greater  | Far      | +25%             | Can issue two orders per pause       |
| Enhanced | Very Far | +35%             | Orders persist through morale breaks |

**Scaling:** +1% compliance per class level

## XP Progression

**XP Sources**:

- Issue orders in combat: 3-8 XP per order
- Have orders followed successfully: 5-15 XP per complied order
- Lead parties in combat: 10-25 XP per combat
- Guided training: 10-100 XP per session
- Unguided training: 5-50 XP per session

**Level-Up Availability Thresholds**:

- Strong synergy classes: ~500 XP (~50 actions)
- Moderate synergy classes: ~1000 XP (~75 actions)
- No synergy classes: ~1500 XP (~100-150 actions)

## Synergy Bonuses

**Strong Synergy Example** (Knight Level 15):

- Faster learning: 2x XP from command actions
- Better effectiveness: +25% compliance bonus
- Reduced cost: -25% stamina per order

**Scaling with Class Level**:

| Class Level | XP Multiplier | Effectiveness | Cost Reduction |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Level 5     | 1.5x (+50%)   | +15%          | -15%           |
| Level 15    | 2.0x (+100%)  | +25%          | -25%           |
| Level 30+   | 2.5x (+150%)  | +35%          | -35%           |

## Mechanics

**Trigger Actions:** Issue orders in combat, have orders followed, lead parties

**Range Definitions:**

- Medium: Within visual range in combat
- Far: Entire battlefield or large area
- Very Far: Can shout orders across extended battlefields

**Compliance Bonus:** Increases chance that allies will follow orders, especially complex or dangerous ones.

**Faster Execution:** Lesser tier causes allies to execute orders more quickly.

**Multiple Orders:** Greater tier allows issuing two orders simultaneously (to different groups or sequential commands).

**Morale Persistence:** Enhanced tier ensures orders remain effective even when allies are shaken or morale-broken.

**Cooldown:** No cooldown on orders, but complex orders require brief pause between issuance.
