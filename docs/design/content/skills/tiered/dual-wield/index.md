# Dual Wield

## Overview

Fight with two weapons effectively, progressively reducing and then eliminating dual-wield penalties while gaining attack speed bonuses and improved off-hand damage.

## Synergy Classes

**Strong Synergy (2x XP)**: Warrior, Adventurer, Thief, Assassin

Classes with strong synergies get faster learning, better effectiveness, and lower costs.

## Tiers

| Tier     | Effect                                  | Scaling                |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Lesser   | -15% penalty (reduced from -30%)        | +1% per class level    |
| Greater  | No penalty, +10% attack speed           | +0.75% per class level |
| Enhanced | +15% attack speed, off-hand damage +25% | +0.5% per class level  |

## XP Progression

**XP Sources**:

- Fight with two weapons: 3-8 XP per combat
- Land off-hand attacks: 5-10 XP per hit
- Kill with off-hand weapon: 10-20 XP per kill
- Guided training: 10-100 XP per session
- Unguided training: 5-50 XP per session

**Level-Up Availability Thresholds**:

- Strong synergy classes: ~500 XP (~50 actions)
- Moderate synergy classes: ~1000 XP (~75 actions)
- No synergy classes: ~1500 XP (~100-150 actions)

## Synergy Bonuses

**Strong Synergy Example** (Warrior Level 15):

- Faster learning: 2x XP from dual-wield combat
- Better effectiveness: +25% attack speed bonus
- Reduced cost: -25% stamina per attack

**Scaling with Class Level**:

| Class Level | XP Multiplier | Effectiveness | Cost Reduction |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Level 5     | 1.5x (+50%)   | +15%          | -15%           |
| Level 15    | 2.0x (+100%)  | +25%          | -25%           |
| Level 30+   | 2.5x (+150%)  | +35%          | -35%           |

## Mechanics

**Trigger Actions:** Fight with two weapons, land off-hand attacks

**Base Penalty:** Without this skill, dual-wielding imposes -30% to accuracy and damage with both weapons. Lesser tier reduces this to -15%.

**Penalty Removal:** Greater tier completely removes dual-wield penalties, allowing both weapons to be used at full effectiveness.

**Attack Speed:** Greater and Enhanced tiers provide bonus attack speed, allowing more attacks per combat round.

**Off-Hand Damage:** Enhanced tier increases off-hand weapon damage by +25%, making it nearly as effective as the main hand.

**Weapon Restrictions:** Typically requires one-handed weapons in both hands. Some very light weapons may dual-wield differently.

**Interaction with Weapon Mastery:** Bonuses from Weapon Mastery apply to each wielded weapon of the appropriate type.
