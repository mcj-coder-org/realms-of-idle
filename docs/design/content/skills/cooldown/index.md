# Cooldown Skills

**Type**: Cooldown
**Description**: Active abilities with a cooldown period before they can be reused.

## Overview

Cooldown skills are powerful active abilities that can be triggered by the player but require a waiting period (cooldown) before they can be used again. These skills often provide significant temporary benefits or game-changing effects.

## Characteristics

- **Active Trigger**: Player must activate the skill
- **Cooldown Period**: Cannot be reused immediately after use
- **Powerful Effects**: Often more impactful than passive skills
- **Strategic Timing**: Effectiveness depends on when you use them
- **Duration-Based**: Many have a specific effect duration

  - **Use Cases**: Emergency escape, repositioning, avoiding detection

## Cooldown Mechanics

### Activation

- **Manual**: Player chooses when to activate
- **Strategic**: Best used at critical moments
- **Resource Cost**: Some may require stamina, mana, or other resources

### Duration vs Cooldown

- **Effect Duration**: How long the skill's benefits last
- **Cooldown**: How long before the skill can be used again
- **Example**: Battle Rage lasts 30-60 seconds but has a 5-minute cooldown

### Tier Scaling

Cooldown skills often have multiple tiers:

- **Lesser**: Basic effect, shorter duration, possible drawbacks
- **Greater**: Enhanced effect, longer duration, reduced drawbacks
- **Enhanced**: Maximum effect, longest duration, minimal/no drawbacks

### Cooldown Reduction

Cooldown times may be reduced by:

- **Class Synergies**: Strong synergy classes get faster cooldowns
- **Equipment**: Special items that reduce recharge times
- **Skill Combos**: Other skills that synergize with cooldowns

## Strategic Usage

### Combat Applications

- **Battle Rage**: Use when facing tough enemies or during boss fights
- **Emergency Response**: Save for critical moments rather than regular combat

### Stealth Applications

- **Vanish**: Perfect for escape when detected or repositioning during infiltration
- **Tactical Retreats**: Break line of sight and flee dangerous situations

### Cooldown Management

- **Track Availability**: Know when skills come off cooldown
- **Plan Encounters**: Engage when cooldowns are available
- **Chain Effects**: Combine with other skills for maximum impact

## Acquisition

Cooldown skills typically require:

- **High Proficiency**: Mastery of related mechanics
- **Rare Training**: Specialized mentors or techniques
- **Class Affinity**: Often restricted to specific class paths
- **Risk/Reward**: May involve dangerous or challenging acquisition methods

## Future Expansion

Potential future cooldown skills:

- **Divine Intervention** (Magic): Call upon divine aid (long cooldown)
- **Second Wind** (Combat): Instant stamina/health recovery
- **Master Distraction** (Stealth): Create major diversion
- **Inspiration** (Leadership): Rally party with massive morale boost

## Balance Considerations

Cooldown skills are balanced by:

- **Limited Usage**: Long cooldowns prevent spam
- **Opportunity Cost**: Must choose right moment to use
- **Drawbacks**: Some have penalties (like Battle Rage's defense reduction)
- **Resource Requirements**: May consume stamina, mana, or items
