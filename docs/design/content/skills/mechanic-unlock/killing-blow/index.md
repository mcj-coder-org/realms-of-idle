## Mechanics

**Trigger Actions:** Land killing blows, finish wounded enemies

**Threshold:** Enemy must be at or below 15% HP to attempt execution.

**Success Calculation:** STR (attacker) contested against END (target). Higher STR relative to target END increases success chance.

**Failure Result:** If execution fails, performs normal attack instead (still dealing damage).

**Execution Method:** Different execution animations/methods based on weapon type.

**Boss Resistance:** Elite and boss enemies may have resistance or immunity to execution.

**Cooldown:** None - can attempt on any eligible enemy.
