## Mechanics

**Trigger Actions:** Ride mounts, fight while mounted, train with mounts

**Base Penalty Removal:** Without this skill, fighting mounted imposes significant accuracy and attack speed penalties. This skill removes those penalties.

**Mounted Charge:** Special attack performed while mount is moving at speed. Deals bonus damage and can break through enemy lines.

**Mount Control:** Mount automatically responds to combat commands without requiring Animal Handling checks.

**Tier 2 - Mounted Mastery:**

- Charge damage increased by +50%
- Can make attacks while mount is moving (normally requires mount to be stationary)
- Mount gains combat awareness and will avoid obvious dangers

**Mount Types:** Works with any rideable mount (horses, wolves, etc.). Effectiveness may vary by mount type.
