# Elven Grace

**Type**: Passive (Racial)
**Tags**: `Physical/Agility`, `Social`
**Typical Races**: High Elf, Wood Elf

## Description

Elves move with supernatural elegance - fluid, precise, and seemingly effortless. This grace is more than physical beauty; it's perfect balance, precise control, and an almost preternatural lightness that makes elves appear to glide rather than walk.

## Mechanics

**Movement Grace:**

- +10% movement speed (faster than base for race)
- Reduced fall damage (-20%)
- Improved balance on narrow surfaces or unstable ground
- Quieter footsteps (passive -10% noise while moving)

**Agility Bonus:**

- +10% to all Finesse-based skill checks
- Improved jumping distance and accuracy
- Better reaction time for dodging
- Enhanced coordination for acrobatic maneuvers

**Social Presence:**

- +5% bonus to Charisma-based interactions
- Appears more refined, cultured, and trustworthy
- First impressions improved with civilized races
- Commands attention in social settings

**Combat Applications:**

- Better positioning and repositioning in melee
- Improved dodge chance (+5%)
- Elegant weapon handling (aesthetic + functional)
- Less likely to be knocked prone

## Acquisition

**Racial:**

- Granted as one of 3 random racial skills at character creation
- Available to High Elves and Wood Elves (different cultural emphasis)
- No XP or training required when granted racially

**Non-Racial:**

- Cannot be learned through training alone
- Requires both physical conditioning and cultural upbringing
- Non-elves never achieve the same natural fluidity

## Scaling

**No Scaling**: Fixed bonuses that do not improve with XP or level.

**Benefit Varies by Build**: More impactful for agility-focused classes (rogues, rangers) than strength-focused builds.

## Interactions

**Synergizes with:**

- [Evasion Expert](../tiered/evasion-expert/index.md) - Enhanced dodging
- [Shadow Step](../tiered/shadow-step/index.md) - Stealth movement
- Rogue, Ranger, Assassin classes
- Light armor builds (full mobility)

**High Elf vs Wood Elf:**

- **High Elves**: Emphasize social grace and refined elegance
- **Wood Elves**: Emphasize natural movement and forest navigation
- Both gain same mechanical benefits, different cultural context

**Examples:**

- Elf leaping between rooftops: +10% agility check, reduced fall damage
- Elf navigating ballroom: +5% CHA, commands attention naturally
- Elf dodging attacks: +5% dodge chance, graceful evasion
- Elf balancing on log: Improved balance check, stable footing
