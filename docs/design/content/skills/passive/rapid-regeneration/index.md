# Rapid Regeneration

**Type**: Passive (Racial)
**Tags**: `Physical/Endurance`, `Nature`
**Typical Races**: Troll

## Description

Trollish regeneration is legendary - wounds close before your eyes, severed limbs regrow, and injuries that would kill others merely slow you down temporarily. Your body constantly repairs itself, making you extraordinarily difficult to kill permanently.

## Mechanics

**Regeneration Rate:**

- Regenerate 5% of maximum HP per minute (out of combat)
- Regenerate 2% of maximum HP per minute (in combat)
- Example: 200 HP → Heal 10 HP/minute out of combat, 4 HP/minute in combat
- Regeneration occurs continuously, not in bursts

**Combat Regeneration:**

- Active even while taking damage
- Healing calculated every 6 seconds (1 combat round)
- Example: 200 HP troll heals ~0.7 HP per round in combat
- Significant over extended battles (20 rounds = 14 HP)

**Limitations:**

- **Fire Vulnerability**: Regeneration stops for 1 minute after taking fire damage
- **Acid Vulnerability**: Regeneration rate reduced by 50% for 1 minute after acid damage
- Does not regenerate from 0 HP (requires consciousness)
- Cannot regrow lost body parts (heals to stump, does not regenerate limbs mid-combat)

**Enhanced Natural Healing:**

- During rest: Heal at 3x normal rate
- Minor wounds (cuts, bruises) heal within hours
- Moderate wounds (deep cuts, broken bones) heal in 1-2 days
- Severe wounds (near-death) heal in 3-5 days

## Acquisition

**Racial:**

- Granted as one of 3 random racial skills at character creation
- Exclusively available to Trolls
- No XP or training required when granted racially

**Non-Racial:**

- Cannot be learned through training
- Only available through racial selection or extremely rare magical effects
- Permanent once acquired

## Scaling

**Percentage-Based**: Scales naturally with HP increases (5% of 100 HP vs 5% of 500 HP).

**No XP Scaling**: Regeneration rate (5%/2% per minute) does not improve with XP or level.

## Combat Applications

**Attrition Warfare:**

- Outlast enemies in prolonged fights
- Recover between encounters faster
- Can afford to trade damage more freely
- Exceptional durability in boss battles

**Tactical Considerations:**

- Avoid fire/acid enemies (counters regeneration)
- Benefit from defensive tactics (buy time to heal)
- Can retreat briefly to regenerate during combat
- Synergizes with high-HP builds

**Examples:**

- Troll Warrior with 300 HP: Heals 15 HP/minute out of combat, fully healed in 20 minutes
- During 10-minute combat: Heals ~60 HP (300 × 0.02 × 10)
- Taking fire damage: Regeneration paused for 1 minute (major tactical disadvantage)

## Interactions

**Synergizes with:**

- [Relentless Endurance](relentless-endurance/index.md) - Survive to 1 HP, then regenerate
- [Thick Skin](thick-skin/index.md) - Reduce damage taken, maximize regeneration
- [Stout Constitution](stout-constitution/index.md) - Higher HP pool = more total regeneration
- High-endurance builds

**Countered by:**

- Fire damage (stops regeneration completely)
- Acid damage (reduces regeneration by 50%)
- Burst damage (can kill before regeneration matters)

**Does NOT:**

- Cure diseases or poisons (only heals HP)
- Remove status effects
- Restore stamina or mana
- Function while unconscious
