# Relentless Endurance

**Type**: Passive (Racial)
**Tags**: `Physical/Endurance`, `Combat`
**Typical Races**: Orc, Troll

## Description

Orcs don't die easily. When an attack would reduce you to 0 HP, your sheer toughness and refusal to fall keeps you standing with 1 HP instead. This isn't regeneration or healing - it's pure stubborn endurance, the kind that makes enemies fear even "defeated" orcs.

## Mechanics

**Death Defiance:**

- Once per day, survive a lethal blow with 1 HP remaining
- Triggers automatically when damage would reduce you to 0 HP
- Cannot be voluntarily activated
- Does not trigger if already at 1 HP

**Trigger Conditions:**

- Must be reduced to 0 HP or below by damage
- Must have Relentless Endurance charge available (refreshes on long rest)
- Character remains conscious and able to act
- All status effects and conditions remain active

**After Triggering:**

- Left with exactly 1 HP (not 0)
- Can still move, act, and fight normally
- Vulnerable to any additional damage
- Must rest to regain Relentless Endurance charge

**Does NOT protect against:**

- Instant death effects (decapitation, disintegration, etc.)
- Damage while already at 1 HP
- Environmental death (drowning, falling from extreme height)

## Acquisition

**Racial:**

- Granted as one of 3 random racial skills at character creation
- Available to exceptionally tough races (Orc, Troll primarily)
- No XP or training required when granted racially

**Non-Racial:**

- Cannot be learned through training
- Only available through racial selection
- Permanent once acquired

## Scaling

**No Scaling**: Always triggers at 0 HP threshold, always leaves 1 HP.

**Refresh**: Recharges on long rest (6-8 hours of rest).

## Combat Applications

**Last Stand:**

- Survive ambushes and surprise lethal attacks
- Continue fighting when others would fall
- Buy time for allies to assist or escape
- Psychological effect on enemies (seeing you stand after "killing blow")

**Strategic Use:**

- Allows aggressive front-line tactics
- Can take calculated risks in combat
- Safety net for dangerous missions
- Extra margin for error in boss fights

**Examples:**

- Orc Warrior takes massive critical hit (180 damage, has 75 HP) → Survives at 1 HP
- Troll Berserker charges recklessly into enemy formation, takes lethal damage → Still standing
- Orc at 1 HP from earlier Relentless Endurance → Next hit actually kills them

## Interactions

**Synergizes with:**

- [Rapid Regeneration](rapid-regeneration/index.md) - Heal back from 1 HP quickly (Troll)
- [Stout Constitution](stout-constitution/index.md) - Higher HP pool delays trigger
- Healing abilities - Restore HP after surviving

**Limited by:**

- Only works once per day
- Requires long rest to recharge
- Does not prevent unconsciousness from other causes
- Vulnerable immediately after use
