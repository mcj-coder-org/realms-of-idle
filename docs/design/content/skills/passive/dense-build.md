# Dense Build

**Type**: Passive (Racial)
**Tags**: `Physical/Strength`, `Physical`
**Typical Races**: Dwarf

## Description

Your body is extraordinarily dense - more muscle, heavier bones, and compact mass packed into a stocky frame. This natural density makes you significantly heavier than your size suggests and grants exceptional stability.

## Mechanics

**Increased Weight:**

- 1.5x normal weight for your size category
- Example: Medium creature typically 180 lbs → 270 lbs as Dwarf
- Affects carrying capacity calculations
- May affect swimming and climbing

**Physical Presence:**

- +10% effectiveness on strength-based skill checks
- Improved leverage for grappling and shoving
- Better footing when pushing or pulling heavy objects
- More effective at blocking and body-checking

**Stability Bonus:**

- Works with Steady Stance for enhanced knockback/knockdown resistance
- Harder to forcibly move or reposition
- Better balance on unstable surfaces
- Resistant to wind and environmental forces

## Acquisition

**Racial:**

- Granted as one of 3 random racial skills at character creation
- Primarily available to Dwarves
- No XP or training required when granted racially

**Non-Racial:**

- Cannot be learned through training
- Only available through racial selection
- Permanent once acquired

## Scaling

**No Scaling**: Fixed racial benefit that does not improve with XP or level.

## Interactions

**Stacks with:**

- [Steady Stance](steady-stance.md) - Combined stability effects
- [Stout Constitution](stout-constitution.md) - Physical resilience synergy
- Strength-based class bonuses

**Trade-offs:**

- Increased weight may affect swimming speed (-10%)
- Climbing may be slightly slower due to mass
- Harder to lift or carry (benefit in wrestling, drawback if incapacitated)
