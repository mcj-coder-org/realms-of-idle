# Stout Constitution

**Type**: Passive (Racial)
**Tags**: `Physical/Endurance`, `Physical`
**Typical Races**: Dwarf, Troll, Ogre

## Description

Your body is built like a boulder - dense, resilient, and incredibly difficult to damage. Whether through stocky dwarven build, trollish regeneration, or ogre mass, you possess extraordinary toughness that lets you shrug off injuries and toxins that would fell others.

## Mechanics

**Health Bonus:**

- +15% maximum health points
- Applies to base HP and all HP gains from levels/classes
- Example: 100 base HP becomes 115 HP

**Poison & Disease Resistance:**

- +20% resistance to poison damage
- +20% resistance to disease effects
- Reduced duration of poison/disease status effects (-25%)
- Faster recovery from toxic conditions

**Constitution Checks:**

- +10% bonus to Endurance-based checks
- Improved stamina recovery rate
- Better resistance to exhaustion effects

## Acquisition

**Racial:**

- Granted as one of 3 random racial skills at character creation
- Available to races with naturally robust physiology
- No XP or training required when granted racially

**Non-Racial:**

- Cannot be learned through training
- Only available through racial selection
- Permanent once acquired

## Scaling

**No Scaling**: This is a fixed racial benefit that does not improve with XP or level.

**Percentage Scaling**: The +15% HP bonus scales naturally as character HP increases through levels and class bonuses.

## Interactions

**Stacks with:**

- Class HP bonuses (additive)
- Equipment HP bonuses (additive)
- Other endurance-based skills (multiplicative with different effects)

**Examples:**

- Dwarf Warrior (Level 10): (Base 120 HP + 18 Warrior bonus) × 1.15 = 159 HP
- Dwarf Blacksmith: Stout Constitution + Physical labor endurance = exceptional stamina
