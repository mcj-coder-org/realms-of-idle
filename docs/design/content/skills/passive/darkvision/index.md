# Darkvision

**Type**: Passive (Racial)
**Tags**: `Physical`, `Universal/Physical`
**Typical Races**: Dwarf, Kobold, Goblin, Orc

## Description

Your eyes have adapted to see in darkness as clearly as others see in daylight. Whether through generations spent underground or natural nocturnal adaptation, you perceive the world without need for light.

## Mechanics

**Vision Range in Darkness:**

- Treat complete darkness as bright light for vision purposes
- See up to normal visual range (120 feet) in absolute darkness
- Perceive shapes, colors, and details as if fully illuminated
- No penalties for dark environments

**Limitations:**

- Does not grant magical sight or see-invisibility
- Cannot see through magical darkness (unless specifically stated)
- Does not extend beyond natural visual range
- Still requires line of sight (cannot see through walls)

**Interaction with Light:**

- No penalties or bonuses in bright light
- Functions identically in any lighting condition
- Transitions instantly between dark and light environments

## Acquisition

**Racial:**

- Granted as one of 3 random racial skills at character creation
- Available to races with underground heritage or nocturnal adaptation
- No XP or training required when granted racially

**Non-Racial:**

- Cannot be learned through training or XP
- Only available through racial selection or magical effects
- Permanent once acquired

## Scaling

**No Scaling**: This is a binary ability - you either have perfect dark vision or you don't.
