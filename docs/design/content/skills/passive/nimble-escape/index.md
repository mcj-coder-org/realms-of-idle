# Nimble Escape

**Type**: Passive (Racial)
**Tags**: `Physical/Agility`, `Stealth`
**Typical Races**: Kobold, Goblin

## Description

Your small size and natural agility let you slip away from danger with practiced ease. Whether ducking between legs, diving into shadows, or simply running away faster than expected, you excel at extracting yourself from bad situations.

## Mechanics

**Quick Disengage:**

- Disengage action costs only bonus action (instead of full action)
- No opportunity attacks when fleeing from melee
- Can disengage and still take full attack action same turn
- 50% reduced stamina cost for disengaging

**Quick Hide:**

- Hide action costs only bonus action (instead of full action)
- Can hide immediately after attacking (same turn)
- Improved stealth check when escaping combat (+10%)
- Can attempt to hide even without full cover (requires concealment)

**Escape Artist:**

- +15% bonus to escape grapples
- Faster movement when fleeing combat (+10% speed)
- Improved dodging when retreating
- Better at squeezing through tight spaces

## Acquisition

**Racial:**

- Granted as one of 3 random racial skills at character creation
- Available to small, agile races (Kobold, Goblin primarily)
- No XP or training required when granted racially

**Non-Racial:**

- Extremely rare for larger races
- Requires exceptional agility training
- Never as effective as small-race natural ability

## Scaling

**No Scaling**: Fixed ability to use bonus action for disengage/hide.

## Combat Applications

**Hit-and-Run Tactics:**

- Attack → Nimble Escape (hide) → Surprise next turn
- Engage → Nimble Escape (disengage) → Retreat safely
- Scout → Report → Nimble Escape (flee) if discovered

**Survival Strategy:**

- Avoid prolonged melee combat with larger foes
- Strike from ambush, then vanish
- Kite enemies while dealing damage
- Escape when outnumbered or outmatched

**Examples:**

- Kobold rogue: Attack → Hide (bonus) → Sneak attack next turn
- Goblin scout: Spot enemy → Nimble Escape → Warn party
- Small races vs large enemies: Hit and run repeatedly
