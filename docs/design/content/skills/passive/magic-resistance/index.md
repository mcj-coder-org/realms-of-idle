# Magic Resistance

**Type**: Passive (Racial)
**Tags**: `Universal/Mental`, `Magic`
**Typical Races**: Dwarf

## Description

The same biological trait that limits spellcasting ability also provides protection against hostile magic. Your body naturally resists magical effects, making spells find less purchase on you than on other targets. This resistance is significant - you can advance through magical barrages that would stop others cold.

## Mechanics

**Hostile Magic Resistance:**

- +20% resistance to all hostile magical damage
- +20% resistance to magical status effects
- Reduced duration of magical debuffs (-25%)
- Improved saving throws against spells (+15%)

**Damage Reduction:**

- Fire spell dealing 100 damage → 80 damage (20% reduction)
- Lightning bolt dealing 150 damage → 120 damage (30 point reduction)
- Applies after other defensive calculations

**Status Effect Resistance:**

- 20% chance to completely resist magical status effects (paralysis, charm, fear, etc.)
- If effect applies, duration reduced by 25%
- Does not protect against beneficial magic

**Limitations:**

- Does NOT reduce friendly/beneficial magic effectiveness
- Does NOT provide protection against physical damage
- Does NOT prevent spell targeting (only reduces effectiveness)
- May make receiving healing magic slightly less effective (optional balancing)

## Acquisition

**Racial:**

- Granted as one of 3 random racial skills at character creation
- Typically available to races with anti-magic biology (Dwarves primarily)
- No XP or training required when granted racially

**Non-Racial:**

- Cannot be learned through normal training
- Only available through racial selection or rare magical items
- Permanent once acquired

## Scaling

**No Natural Scaling**: Base 20% resistance does not improve with XP or level.

**Enhancement Options** (via items/feats):

- Magical items may provide additional stacking resistance
- Rare enchantments can boost to 30-40% total resistance
- Some class abilities provide temporary resistance boosts

## Trade-offs

**Racial Balance** (Dwarves):

- **Benefit**: Excellent protection against hostile magic
- **Cost**: Reduced mana pool (-35%) and mana regeneration (-25%)
- **Design**: Encourages martial/physical builds over magical ones

## Interactions

**Stacks with:**

- Class-based magic resistance (additive)
- Equipment resistance bonuses (additive)
- Temporary spell resistance buffs (multiplicative)

**Examples:**

- Dwarf Warrior with Magic Resistance ring (+10%): 30% total resistance
- Dwarf with Iron Will (mental fortitude): Enhanced save bonus stacking
- Dwarf Mage: Still benefits from resistance despite reduced casting power

**Combat Applications:**

- Front-line fighters shrugging off area spells
- Advancing through magical defenses
- Surviving magical ambushes
- Reduced fear of enemy spellcasters
