# Stone Sense

**Type**: Passive (Racial)
**Tags**: `Gathering/Mining`, `Physical`, `Knowledge`
**Typical Races**: Dwarf

## Description

Dwarves don't just see stone - they _understand_ it. Through generations of living in stone halls and working underground, you've developed an intuitive sense for structural integrity, hidden veins of ore, and the subtle characteristics that reveal a tunnel's safety. This isn't magic; it's deep knowledge born from a lifetime surrounded by rock.

## Mechanics

**Structural Analysis:**

- Automatically detect unstable structures within touch range
- Assess tunnel/cave stability with 90% accuracy
- Identify load-bearing walls and weak points
- Predict collapse risks in underground spaces

**Ore Detection:**

- Sense valuable ore veins within 10 feet of solid stone
- Identify ore type (iron, gold, gems, etc.) through touch
- Estimate ore purity and deposit size
- Locate best excavation points for maximum yield

**Underground Navigation:**

- Innate sense of depth and direction underground
- Never become disoriented in caves or mines
- Estimate distance traveled and elevation changes
- Recognize previously visited tunnels and chambers

**Stone Quality Assessment:**

- Determine stone quality for crafting by touch
- Identify ideal stone for specific uses (building, carving, etc.)
- Detect fractures or flaws invisible to the eye
- Assess worked stone for craftsmanship quality

## Acquisition

**Racial:**

- Granted as one of 3 random racial skills at character creation
- Primarily available to Dwarves (cultural and biological heritage)
- No XP or training required when granted racially

**Non-Racial:**

- Exceptionally rare for non-Dwarves
- Requires decades of underground living to develop partial ability
- Never matches Dwarven innate mastery

## Scaling

**XP-Based Improvement** (Optional):

- Base ability granted at 100% effectiveness
- Further XP investment can extend range and accuracy
- 1000 XP: +5 feet detection range, +5% accuracy
- 3000 XP: +10 feet range, +10% accuracy, sense gem types
- 5000 XP: +15 feet range, assess magical properties of stone

**Typical Use**: Most characters use Stone Sense at base effectiveness without investing additional XP.

## Interactions

**Synergizes with:**

- [Deep Vein](../mechanic-unlock/deep-vein.md) - Locate rich ore deposits
- [Prospector](../mechanic-unlock/prospector.md) - Survey areas for resources
- [Resource Sense](../tiered/resource-sense.md) - Ore detection at range
- Miner class - Enhanced mining efficiency and yield

**Practical Applications:**

- Mining: Find best ore veins, avoid cave-ins
- Combat: Identify ambush points, structural weaknesses
- Exploration: Navigate safely through underground complexes
- Crafting: Select ideal stone for projects
