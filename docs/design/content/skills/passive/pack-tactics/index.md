# Pack Tactics

**Type**: Passive (Racial)
**Tags**: `Combat/Tactics`, `Tribal`, `Nature/Animals`
**Typical Races**: Kobold, Gnoll, Goblin

## Description

You instinctively coordinate with nearby allies, using pack hunting tactics learned from wolves, hyenas, or simply survival necessity. Fighting alone is dangerous; fighting together is deadly.

## Mechanics

**Combat Advantage:**

- +15% attack accuracy when an ally is within 5 feet of your target
- +10% damage when flanking (ally opposite side of target)
- Improved critical hit chance (+5%) when outnumbering target
- Bonus applies to melee and ranged attacks

**Coordination Bonus:**

- Allies within 10 feet gain +5% attack accuracy against your target
- Improved initiative when fighting with 2+ allies
- Better positioning and movement coordination in group combat
- Reduced friendly fire risk in chaotic melee

**Pack Size Scaling:**

- 1 ally nearby: +15% accuracy
- 2+ allies nearby: +15% accuracy, +5% crit chance
- 3+ allies nearby: +20% accuracy, +10% crit chance, +5% damage
