# Thick Skin

**Type**: Passive (Racial)
**Tags**: `Physical/Endurance`, `Physical`
**Typical Races**: Troll, Ogre, Lizardfolk

## Description

Your skin is as tough as leather - thick, calloused, and resistant to damage. Whether from trollish regeneration creating durable tissue, ogre density, or lizardfolk scales, you possess natural armor that reduces incoming physical damage.

## Mechanics

**Natural Armor:**

- +2 base armor class (equivalent to leather armor)
- Stacks with worn armor (does not replace)
- Always active, cannot be removed or sundered
- Applies to all physical damage types

**Damage Reduction:**

- Reduce physical damage by 5% before other calculations
- Example: 100 damage attack → 95 damage after Thick Skin
- Does not apply to magical damage
- Stacks multiplicatively with armor bonuses

**Environmental Protection:**

- Reduced damage from environmental hazards (thorns, rough terrain)
- Better resistance to extreme temperatures (heat/cold)
- Improved resistance to minor cuts and scrapes
- Less affected by exposure effects

## Acquisition

**Racial:**

- Granted as one of 3 random racial skills at character creation
- Available to races with naturally tough hides
- No XP or training required when granted racially

**Non-Racial:**

- Cannot be learned through training
- Only available through racial selection
- Permanent once acquired

## Scaling

**No Scaling**: Fixed +2 AC and 5% damage reduction that does not improve.

## Interactions

**Stacks with:**

- Worn armor (additive AC bonus)
- [Stout Constitution](stout-constitution.md) (both increase survivability)
- Armor-boosting enchantments
- Class defensive bonuses

**Does NOT stack with:**

- Other natural armor racial skills (use highest value)

**Examples:**

- Troll wearing leather (AC 2): Base 2 + Leather 2 + Thick Skin 2 = 6 AC
- Ogre with Thick Skin taking 200 damage: 200 × 0.95 = 190 damage
