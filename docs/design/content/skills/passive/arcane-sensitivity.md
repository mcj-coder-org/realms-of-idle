# Arcane Sensitivity

**Type**: Passive (Racial)
**Tags**: `Magic`, `Knowledge`
**Typical Races**: High Elf

## Description

Centuries of magical study have attuned your senses to the flow of mana. You perceive magical energies as naturally as others sense light or sound, granting intuitive understanding of arcane forces and enhanced spellcasting ability.

## Mechanics

**Magical Awareness:**

- Automatically detect active magic within 30 feet
- Sense general nature of magical effects (enchantment, evocation, etc.)
- Notice magical items and enchanted objects at a glance
- Perceive invisible magical phenomena (wards, glyphs, summoning circles)

**Spellcasting Enhancement:**

- +5% spell accuracy (magical attacks more likely to hit)
- +5% spell effectiveness (slightly stronger magical effects)
- Better mana control (5% reduced casting cost for all spells)
- Improved concentration on complex spells

**Magical Knowledge:**

- Faster identification of unknown spells
- Better understanding of magical theory
- Improved learning speed for new spells (10% XP reduction)
- Enhanced ability to reverse-engineer magical effects

**Mana Manipulation:**

- More precise mana channeling
- Reduced mana waste when casting
- Better control over spell intensity
- Improved ability to suppress or enhance magical effects

## Acquisition

**Racial:**

- Granted as one of 3 random racial skills at character creation
- Primarily available to High Elves (centuries of magical tradition)
- No XP or training required when granted racially

**Non-Racial:**

- Extremely rare for non-elven races
- Requires decades of intensive magical study
- Never matches elven innate sensitivity

## Scaling
