# Savage Attacks

**Type**: Passive (Racial)
**Tags**: `Combat/Melee`, `Physical/Strength`
**Typical Races**: Orc

## Description

When orcs strike, they strike to kill. Your attacks carry brutal, savage force that makes critical hits devastating. When you land that perfect blow, you don't just hit harder - you hit with overwhelming, bone-crushing violence.

## Mechanics

**Critical Hit Bonus:**

- Roll one additional weapon damage die on critical hits
- Applies to melee weapon attacks only
- Example: Greatsword crit (2d6 × 2) → (3d6 × 2) with Savage Attacks
- Bonus applies before multiplying for critical

**Damage Calculation:**

```
Normal Crit: (Weapon Dice × 2) + Modifiers
Savage Attacks: ((Weapon Dice + 1) × 2) + Modifiers

Example with longsword (1d8):
Normal Crit: 2d8 + STR modifier
Savage Attacks: 3d8 + STR modifier
```

**Applies to:**

- All melee weapon critical hits
- Natural weapons (claws, bite, etc.) if applicable
- Improvised melee weapons
- Unarmed strikes

**Does NOT apply to:**

- Ranged weapon attacks
- Spell damage
- Non-critical hits
- Damage over time effects

## Acquisition

**Racial:**

- Granted as one of 3 random racial skills at character creation
- Primarily available to Orcs
- No XP or training required when granted racially

**Non-Racial:**

- Cannot be learned through training
- Only available through racial selection
- Permanent once acquired

## Scaling

**Weapon Scaling**: Bonus increases with larger weapons (greatsword 2d6 gains more than dagger 1d4).

**No XP Scaling**: Always adds one weapon die, does not improve with level.

## Combat Applications

**Burst Damage:**

- Extremely high damage on critical hits
- Punishes enemies who rely on high AC
- Excellent for finishing blows
- Fear factor in combat

**Build Synergy:**

- Works best with high crit chance builds
- Benefits from two-handed weapons (larger dice)
- Excellent for warriors and berserkers
- Pairs well with crit-fishing tactics

**Examples:**

- Orc Barbarian with greataxe (1d12) crits: 3d12 × 2 + STR (devastating)
- Orc Fighter dual-wielding: More attacks = more crit opportunities
- Orc with maul (2d6): Crits for 4d6 × 2 damage

## Interactions

**Synergizes with:**

- High critical hit chance abilities
- Two-handed weapon mastery
- [Weapon Mastery](../tiered/weapon-mastery/index.md) - Improved crit range
- Berserker/Barbarian rage effects

**Stacks with:**

- Other critical hit damage bonuses (multiplicative)
- Strength modifiers (applied after dice)
- Weapon enchantments

**Does NOT stack with:**

- Other "extra die on crit" effects (use highest)
