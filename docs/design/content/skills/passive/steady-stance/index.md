# Steady Stance

**Type**: Passive (Racial)
**Tags**: `Physical/Endurance`, `Combat/Defense`, `Physical`
**Typical Races**: Dwarf

## Description

Dwarves are hard to move. Your low center of gravity, dense musculature, and natural balance make you nearly immovable when you plant your feet. Knockback effects that send humans flying barely budge you. Trips and knockdowns that reliably fell other races meet your dwarven mass and simply fail.

## Mechanics

**Knockback Resistance:**

- +70% resistance to knockback effects
- Knockback distance reduced by 70%
- Example: 20-foot knockback becomes 6-foot knockback
- Complete immunity to weak knockback effects (less than 5 feet)

**Knockdown Resistance:**

- +50% chance to resist trip/knockdown attempts
- Improved stability checks when balance threatened
- Faster recovery if knockdown succeeds (half time to stand)
- Cannot be tripped by creatures smaller than Medium size

**Grappling Defense:**

- +15% bonus to resist forced movement in grapples
- Harder to drag or push when grabbed
- Improved ground positioning if forced down

**Environmental Stability:**

- Resist wind effects (magical or natural)
- Better footing on unstable ground (ice, mud, slopes)
- Improved balance on narrow surfaces
- Less affected by earthquake/tremor effects

## Acquisition

**Racial:**

- Granted as one of 3 random racial skills at character creation
- Primarily available to Dwarves (low center of gravity, dense build)
- No XP or training required when granted racially

**Non-Racial:**

- Cannot be learned through normal training
- Only available through racial selection
- Permanent once acquired

## Scaling

**No Scaling**: This is a fixed racial benefit - your resistance percentages do not improve with level or XP.

## Combat Applications

**Defensive Advantages:**

- Hold front-line positions against charging enemies
- Resist bull rush and overrun attacks
- Maintain formation in chaotic melee
- Cannot be easily repositioned by enemies

**Tactical Uses:**

- Anchor shield walls and defensive formations
- Guard narrow passages without being displaced
- Block doorways and chokepoints effectively
- Protect vulnerable allies by holding position

**Examples:**

- Giant swings massive club (normally 25-foot knockback) → Dwarf moves 7 feet
- Charging ogre attempts bull rush → Dwarf resists completely
- Dragon wing buffet (10-foot knockback) → Dwarf barely shifts

## Interactions

**Stacks with:**

- [Shield Wall](../tiered/shield-wall/index.md) - Combined knockback immunity
- [Armor Expert](../tiered/armor-expert/index.md) - Heavy armor stability bonus

**Synergizes with:**

- Front-line warrior builds
- Tank and defensive roles
- Defensive combat tactics
- Heavy armor usage

**Does NOT provide:**

- Damage reduction from impacts
- Protection from ranged attacks
- Immunity to magical forced movement (teleportation, levitation)
- Protection from environmental hazards (falling, drowning)
