# Scaly Hide

**Type**: Passive (Racial)
**Tags**: `Physical/Endurance`, `Nature`
**Typical Races**: Lizardfolk

## Description

Your body is covered in tough reptilian scales that serve as natural armor. These overlapping scales deflect blows, turn blades, and provide protection without weighing you down like metal armor.

## Mechanics

**Natural Armor:**

- +3 base armor class (better than leather, equivalent to studded leather)
- Stacks with worn armor (does not replace)
- Always active, cannot be removed or sundered
- Applies to all physical damage types

**Scale Properties:**

- Lightweight and flexible (no mobility penalty)
- Can be painted or adorned without losing effectiveness
- Grows back if damaged (heals like normal wounds)
- Adapts to body temperature (comfortable in various climates)

**Damage Reduction:**

- Reduce physical damage by 5% before other calculations
- Does not apply to magical or elemental damage
- Provides minor protection against environmental hazards
- Better protection than unarmored skin

## Acquisition

**Racial:**

- Granted as one of 3 random racial skills at character creation
- Exclusively available to Lizardfolk
- No XP or training required when granted racially

**Non-Racial:**

- Cannot be learned or acquired
- Only available through racial selection
- Permanent once acquired

## Scaling

**No Scaling**: Fixed +3 AC and 5% damage reduction that does not improve.

## Interactions

**Stacks with:**

- Worn armor (additive AC bonus)
- [Thick Skin](thick-skin/index.md) - Use highest AC bonus if both present
- Armor-boosting enchantments
- Class defensive bonuses

**Works well with:**

- Unarmored or light armor builds (monks, rogues, rangers)
- Swamp/water environments (no rust, no waterlogging)
- Stealth (quieter than metal armor)
- Swimming (no armor weight penalty)

**Examples:**

- Lizardfolk wearing no armor: 3 AC (better than most unarmored)
- Lizardfolk wearing leather (AC 2): Base 2 + Scaly Hide 3 = 5 AC
- Lizardfolk ranger: Natural armor allows full mobility and stealth

## Trade-offs

**Benefits:**

- Free AC bonus without equipment investment
- No maintenance required (unlike metal armor)
- No stealth penalty from "armor"
- Effective even while sleeping or ambushed

**Limitations:**

- Lower AC than heavy armor
- Cannot be upgraded like equipment
- Does not provide complete protection
- May be uncomfortable for non-reptiles to witness
