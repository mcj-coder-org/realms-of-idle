# Elves

## Lore

### Origin

Elves remember when the great forests were young. Their oral histories stretch back thousands of years, not as myth but as living memory passed from elders who actually witnessed those ancient times. "My grandmother's grandmother saw the First Council," an elf might say casually, referring to events that occurred before most human kingdoms existed.

Magic flows through elves as naturally as blood. Where human mages must study and struggle to channel mana, elven children accidentally levitate toys when excited. This isn't superiority - though some elves certainly think it is - but fundamental nature. Magic shaped the elven form over countless generations, leaving them graceful, patient, and deeply attuned to the arcane currents flowing through the world.

This magical nature brings a cost. Elves reproduce slowly; a century might pass between births in a family line. Coupled with their extremely long lives, this creates societies where everyone knows everyone, where grudges last lifetimes, and where change happens at a glacial pace. What humans accomplish in frantic decades, elves approach with serene centuries of preparation.

The great elven civilizations rose in the deep forests and isolated valleys where magic pooled strongest. They built cities that grew rather than were constructed - living wood shaped by patient cultivation into soaring towers and elegant halls. These settlements endure for millennia, accumulating layer upon layer of history, art, and knowledge that younger races can barely comprehend.

### In the World

To walk through an elven settlement is to step into living history. Trees planted a thousand years ago form the bones of buildings. Artwork adorns walls in styles that predate human written language. The elf serving you tea might have fought in wars you only know from crumbling chronicles. Everything feels simultaneously ancient and perfectly maintained - because to elves, a century-old repair is practically new.

Elves approach daily life with maddening (to [humans](../humans.md)) deliberation. Why rush a decision that can be reconsidered for the next fifty years? Why quickly patch a problem instead of taking a decade to solve it permanently? Why choose the fast solution when the elegant one is only a few years away? This patience makes elves incredible scholars, master crafters, and terrible business partners for anyone on a mortal timeline.

Other races have complicated relationships with elves. [Humans](../humans.md) admire elven grace and magical prowess while finding their condescension insufferable. [Dwarves](dwarves/base.md) respect elven craftsmanship (grudgingly) while thinking them impractical dreamers. [Tribal races](../../monstrous/index.md) often view elves with suspicion - those long-lived folk remember tribal raids from generations past and don't forget easily. Yet everyone wants elven-made items, elven magical knowledge, and elven diplomatic support.

Elves integrate into [human](../humans.md) societies more readily than you'd expect for such long-lived beings. An elf might spend a few decades in a human city as a "working vacation" from elven [settlements](../../../systems/world/settlements.md), teaching [magic](../../../systems/character/magic-system.md), crafting masterworks, or simply observing how quickly things change. They return with stories of human friends who grew old while the elf barely aged - a bittersweet reality elves learn young. "Love humans if you must," goes the elven saying, "but prepare to grieve."

The greatest challenge for elves isn't other races but themselves. Five centuries of life means five centuries of accumulated grudges, regrets, and sorrows. Elder elves often retreat into scholarship or meditation, not from wisdom but from weariness. The world changes faster than they can adapt, and watching everything you knew fade away - friends, places, customs - takes a toll no magic can heal.

### Common Elven Traits

**Arcane Blood**: [Magic](../../../systems/character/magic-system.md) doesn't just flow through elves - it is part of them. Their [mana pools](../../../systems/character/magic-system.md) are significantly larger than [humans'](../humans.md) (+25%), and they regenerate mana faster naturally (+20%). This makes elven [mages](../../../classes/magic/index.md) formidable even without training differences.

**Longevity**: Elves don't just live long (600-800 years) - they age slowly. An elf of 200 looks like a [human](../humans.md) of 30. This longevity affects everything from [skill development](../../../systems/character/index.md) to social relationships. Elves can afford to spend decades mastering a single technique.

**Low-Light Vision**: Elven eyes adapt to faint light beautifully, allowing them to read by starlight or navigate forest depths by moon glow. This isn't [darkvision](../../../skills/passive/darkvision.md) - pitch black still blinds them - but twilight and shadow pose no problem.

**Frail**: The cost of magical enhancement and longevity is physical fragility (-10% base health compared to [humans](../humans.md)). Elves bruise more easily, fall ill more readily, and generally can't take as much physical punishment. They compensate with grace and [magic](../../../systems/character/magic-system.md).

## Cultural Notes

### Time Perception

The single biggest cultural barrier between elves and humans is time perception. What seems reasonable planning to an elf - "let's reconvene in five years" - strikes humans as absurd delay. What seems breakneck pace to an elf - "we must decide this month!" - feels glacial to humans. Business partnerships often founder on this mismatch.

### The Burden of Memory

Elves remember _everything_. That insult from 80 years ago? Fresh as yesterday. That beautiful sunrise from 200 years past? Vivid and clear. This perfect recall is both gift and curse. Elves accumulate grudges like humans accumulate years. Feuds between elven families can span centuries, the original cause long lost to everyone but the participants.

### Elven Grief

The greatest tragedy of elven existence is outliving everyone you love. Unless you exclusively befriend elves - and even then, accidents happen - you will watch friends age and die while you barely change. Human friends are especially painful; you'll outlive their grandchildren's grandchildren. Most elves handle this by maintaining emotional distance from mortals, which comes across as coldness but is really self-preservation.

### The Patient Gamblers

Elves play the longest games. A human merchant might plan five years ahead. A dwarf might consider the next generation. An elf plants orchards knowing they'll enjoy the fruit themselves in a century. This long-term thinking produces stable, enduring societies - but also resistance to necessary change. "Why reform now? We've survived two thousand years this way" is a compelling argument when the speaker personally remembers those two thousand years.

### Art and Beauty

Elves pursue beauty with religious fervor. A human might spend months on a masterwork. An elf might spend decades, then declare it practice and start over. Elven art often confuses other races - it's technically perfect but emotionally cold, focused on ideal forms rather than passionate expression. The exceptions - elves who create with human-like urgency and fire - produce works that transcend racial boundaries.

### The Arrogance Question

Are elves arrogant? Yes, but not always in the way other races think. It's not that elves believe they're better (though some do). It's that from an elven perspective, other races are children making childish mistakes, rushing into predictable disasters, refusing to wait for wisdom. An elf watching humans start a war over a slight looks like a parent watching toddlers fight over toys - simultaneously pitying and exasperated.

Of course, this patronizing attitude drives other races crazy, creating the friction elves then cite as evidence that shorter-lived folk are too emotional. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy that wise elves recognize and try to break.
