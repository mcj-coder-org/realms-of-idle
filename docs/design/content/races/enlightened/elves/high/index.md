# High Elf

> **Parent Race:** [Elves](base.md)

## Variant Overview

High Elves represent elven culture at its most refined and magically potent. They dwell in ancient cities where soaring towers grow from living wood, where libraries contain knowledge accumulated over millennia, and where every interaction follows protocols established before most human kingdoms existed. High elves are the most magically gifted of all elven variants, with children manifesting abilities that human mages spend years struggling to achieve.

Their magical prowess is undeniable, their accumulated wisdom vast, and their arrogance equally substantial. High elves often view other elves (let alone other races) with polite condescension - not from malice but from the perspective of beings who personally remember events that others consider ancient history.

## Region

Ancient elven cities built in magical confluences where arcane energy pools strongest. These settlements - places like Silvermoon Spire, Starweave Court, and the Eternal Archives - have stood for thousands of years, each generation adding new layers of art, knowledge, and architectural wonder. Built primarily from living wood shaped by patient cultivation, these cities are simultaneously beautiful, ancient, and alive.

## Magic Affinity

**Primary Schools:** Arcane, Abjuration

High Elves excel at pure arcane manipulation and protective magic. They approach spellcasting as both art and science, spending decades perfecting techniques and researching new applications. Their protective wards are legendary - some high elf settlements have maintained the same defensive enchantments for over a thousand years, each generation strengthening what came before.

## Tag Affinities

| Affinity Type | Tags                           | Effect                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Strong (+)    | Magic, Knowledge               | Fastest learning, best XP |
| Positive (○)  | Crafting, Social/Persuasion    | Faster than baseline      |
| Negative (×)  | Physical/Strength, Agriculture | Slower, higher XP cost    |

See [Racial Synergies](../../../systems/character/racial-synergies.md) for detailed mechanics.

## Skill Pool Tags

`Magic`, `Knowledge`, `Social/Persuasion`, `Physical/Agility`

High Elves receive **3 random skills** from their racial skill pool at character creation, with additional skills available at racial milestone levels (10, 25, 50). Skills must match at least one of the pool tags above.

## Cultural Distinctions

High Elves take their role as cultural preservers seriously. They maintain the most complete historical records, the most extensive magical libraries, and the most elaborate courtly traditions. Every interaction follows precise protocol; every decision considers centuries of precedent. This produces stable, enduring societies but also profound resistance to change.

Their cities function as both political centers and universities. Young high elves spend decades in formal education before being considered truly adult - and even then, they're expected to continue learning throughout their long lives. A high elf "generalist" might have spent a century studying magic, another century on history, and be currently working through their third century focusing on diplomacy.

High elves are the most likely to engage with human scholarship and magical communities, though always from a position of assumed superiority. A high elf might spend decades in a human magical academy as a "visiting scholar" - teaching, researching, and quietly correcting what they view as human misconceptions about proper magical theory.

## Relations

**With Other Elves:** High Elves view themselves as the pinnacle of elven civilization. They respect Wood Elves but consider them rustic and overly focused on nature over culture. Sea Elves seem exotic and somewhat peculiar - all that time in the water seems wasteful when there are libraries to study. Dusk Elves are a complicated subject; high elves maintain polite distance while privately viewing them with pity and disapproval.

**With Other Races:** High Elves maintain carefully calibrated relationships with other races. They respect [human](../humans.md) ambition while patronizing human "rushed" decision-making. [Dwarves](../dwarves/base.md) earn respect for their craftsmanship but are viewed as artistically limited and overly practical. [Tribal races](../../monstrous/index.md) are studied with academic interest but kept at distance - high elves remember tribal conflicts from centuries past.

## Recommended Classes

High Elves excel at magic-focused classes that leverage their enhanced mana capacity and knowledge accumulation:

- **[Mage](../../../classes/magic/index.md)**: Natural fit, combining racial magic affinity with scholarly approach
- **[Enchanter](../../../classes/magic/index.md)**: Perfect for patient, methodical enchantment work
- **[Spellblade](../../../classes/magic/index.md)**: Blends magic with finesse-based combat
- **[Scholar](../../../classes/index.md)**: Maximum knowledge accumulation and research capability
- **[Diplomat](../../../classes/../systems/social/index.md)**: Leverages social skills and accumulated wisdom
- **[Arcanist](../../../classes/magic/index.md)**: Deep specialization in pure arcane theory

Less suitable for strength-based martial classes or agricultural pursuits due to racial negative affinities, though high elf [Rangers](../../../classes/combat/index.md) who focus on magic and agility rather than strength can be effective.
