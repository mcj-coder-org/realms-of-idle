# Wood Elf

> **Parent Race:** [Elves](base.md)

## Variant Overview

Wood Elves adapted to life in deep forests, becoming more practical and less formal than their high elf cousins while retaining elven grace and magical nature. They move through dense woodland like living shadows, communicate with forest creatures, and understand the rhythms of the natural world with instinctive precision. Where high elves build soaring cities, wood elves cultivate settlements that blend so seamlessly with the forest that outsiders can walk past without noticing.

Other races find wood elves more approachable than high elves - less concerned with ancient protocol, more willing to engage directly, and possessing a dry humor about elven pretensions. Still maddeningly elven in their patience and long-term perspective, but practical enough to work with shorter-lived folk without constant condescension.

## Region

Deep forests, ancient woodlands, and remote groves where civilization has barely touched. Wood elf settlements grow naturally from the forest itself - homes shaped from living trees, paths that follow game trails, and communities so integrated with their environment that they seem part of the forest's natural ecology. They favor places of old growth where magic and nature intertwine.

## Magic Affinity

**Primary Schools:** Nature, Illusion

Wood Elves excel at nature magic that works with rather than against the natural world, and illusion magic that aids stealth and misdirection. Their spells feel less like imposing will on reality and more like asking reality to cooperate. A wood elf's illusion doesn't fight perception - it quietly suggests that perhaps you should look elsewhere.

## Cultural Distinctions

Wood Elves maintain a different relationship with time than other elves. While still patient by human standards, they think in seasons and growth cycles rather than centuries of abstract planning. A wood elf watches the forest change year by year, tracking patterns that play out across decades but remaining connected to immediate reality in ways high elves sometimes lose.

Their settlements function more as extended family groups than formal cities. Leadership emerges from respect and proven ability rather than ancient lineage. Young wood elves learn by doing - spending years ranging through forests, learning from experience, and developing the practical skills that forest life demands.

Wood elves are skilled hunters and trackers, moving through dense woodland with unnatural silence. They view hunting as collaboration with the forest - taking only what's needed, using every part of their kill, and maintaining the balance that keeps the woods healthy. Other races sometimes view this as mystical; wood elves see it as practical ecology learned over lifetimes.

## Relations

**With Other Elves:** Wood Elves have complicated feelings about high elves - respect for their knowledge mixed with frustration at their impracticality. High elves sometimes patronize wood elves as "rustic," which wood elves find hilarious given that high elves couldn't survive a week in actual wilderness. Sea Elves are viewed as kindred spirits - also adapted to specific environments, also practical. Dusk Elves puzzle wood elves; choosing underground darkness over forest glory seems incomprehensible.

**With Other Races:** Wood Elves work well with [humans](../humans.md), especially rangers and druids who understand forest life. They respect [dwarves](../dwarves/base.md) for their craftsmanship while finding them too focused on stone and metal over living wood. Tribal races, particularly forest-dwelling ones, are often viewed as neighbors - sometimes allies, sometimes competitors for territory, but always respected as fellow forest dwellers.

## Recommended Classes

Wood Elves excel at nature-focused and agility-based classes that leverage their forest mastery:

- **[Ranger](../../../classes/combat/index.md)**: Perfect fit, combining nature affinity with combat prowess
- **[Druid](../../../classes/magic/index.md)**: Natural connection to nature magic and forest harmony
- **[Scout](../../../classes/index.md)**: Enhanced stealth and tracking in natural environments
- **[Archer](../../../classes/combat/index.md)**: Leverages agility and ranged combat affinity
- **[Herbalist](../../../classes/crafting/index.md)**: Deep knowledge of forest plants and remedies
- **[Beastmaster](../../../classes/index.md)**: Works with animal companions and beast empathy

Less suitable for heavy melee combat or smithing due to racial negative affinities, though wood elf [Rogues](../../../classes/combat/index.md) who focus on stealth and agility can be exceptionally effective.
