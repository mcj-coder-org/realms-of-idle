# Sea Elf

> **Parent Race:** [Elves](base/index.md)

## Variant Overview

Sea Elves took to the oceans millennia ago, developing the ability to breathe water and swim with supernatural grace. They maintain dual lives - equally comfortable in coastal settlements trading with land-dwellers and in mysterious underwater cities built from coral and shaped currents. Where other elves watch forests or cities change over centuries, sea elves track the slow dance of ocean currents, the migration of great leviathans, and the rise and fall of coastal civilizations.

They're explorers and traders, connecting distant coastal settlements, mapping uncharted waters, and maintaining knowledge of safe passages that shorter-lived sailors never live to learn completely. Coastal humans respect sea elves as master mariners and valuable trading partners. Inland folk consider them exotic curiosities - elves who chose water over land or forest.

## Region

Coastal settlements, island chains, and underwater cities built from living coral and shaped stone. Sea elf architecture reflects their dual nature - buildings that function both above and below the waterline, with rooms that can flood or drain as needed. Their underwater cities, hidden in deep trenches and sheltered bays, represent some of the most alien elven construction - beautiful but fundamentally inhuman in their fluid, three-dimensional design.

## Magic Affinity

**Primary Schools:** Water, Conjuration

Sea Elves excel at water manipulation and conjuration magic that summons or transports across distances. Their water magic feels less like control and more like partnership - asking the ocean to cooperate rather than forcing compliance. Their conjuration abilities make them excellent at creating temporary structures, summoning useful items, and establishing magical transportation networks between distant ports.

## Cultural Distinctions

Sea Elves think in terms of tides and currents, cycles that repeat but never quite the same way twice. They're more comfortable with change than other elves - the ocean never stays static, and sea elves learned to flow with it rather than resist. This makes them excellent traders and diplomats, able to adapt to different coastal cultures while maintaining their core identity.

Their underwater cities represent unique elven architecture - three-dimensional spaces where "up" and "down" are suggestions rather than rules. Non-aquatic visitors find these spaces disorienting; sea elves move through them as naturally as humans walk city streets. These cities maintain independence from surface politics while trading extensively with both land-dwelling elves and coastal settlements.

Sea elves are legendary navigators, maintaining charts that track not just current geography but centuries of coastal changes. They know which underwater routes are safe, which reefs are growing or dying, and where the great ocean currents shift with the seasons. This knowledge makes them invaluable to any serious maritime expedition.

## Relations

**With Other Elves:** Sea Elves maintain friendly but distant relationships with other elven variants. High elves view them with mild puzzlement - all that time in water seems wasteful - but respect their magical achievements. Wood elves see sea elves as kindred spirits, both adapted to specific environments. Dusk elves and sea elves rarely interact but share the experience of being considered "different" by mainstream elven society.

**With Other Races:** Sea Elves work extensively with coastal [humans](../humans/index.md), forming trading partnerships and teaching maritime skills. Island-dwelling [humans](../humans/index.md) often have multi-generational relationships with sea elf families. [Dwarves](../dwarves/base/index.md) rarely interact with sea elves - dwarven discomfort with open water and sea elven aquatic nature don't mix well. Coastal [tribal races](../../monstrous/index.md) are sometimes trading partners, sometimes territorial competitors for fishing grounds.

## Recommended Classes

Sea Elves excel at magic-focused classes with maritime applications and agility-based combat:

- **[Mage](../../../classes/magic/index.md)**: Specializing in water and conjuration magic
- **[Sailor](../../../classes/index.md)**: Master mariners with magical enhancement
- **[Merchant](../../../classes/../systems/social/index.md)**: Trading connections across coastal networks
- **[Explorer](../../../classes/index.md)**: Discovering and mapping new waters
- **[Conjurer](../../../classes/magic/index.md)**: Specialized summoning and transportation magic
- **[Diplomat](../../../classes/../systems/social/index.md)**: Bridging cultures across coastal settlements

Less suitable for heavy armor combat or landlocked pursuits. Sea elves who venture far inland often feel uncomfortable and disconnected from their element, though they adapt better than one might expect given their aquatic nature.
