# Humans

## Lore

### Origin

Humans are the heartbeat of the known world - adaptable, ambitious, and everywhere. No one quite agrees on where humanity first arose; every region has villages claiming to be "the oldest" or "the first." What's certain is that humans spread faster than any other race, settling from frozen tundra to scorching desert, from mountain peaks to coastal shores.

Where elves measure time in centuries and dwarves in generations, humans burn bright and fast. A human lifetime is barely long enough to master a single craft, yet they pour themselves into their work with fierce dedication. "We don't have time to waste" is as much a human motto as any, and it shows in everything they build, create, and fight for.

This urgency breeds innovation. While elves perfect ancient techniques and dwarves honor traditional methods, humans experiment constantly. Sometimes spectacularly successful, sometimes disastrously wrong, but never satisfied with "good enough." The newest farming technique, the latest sword design, the innovative trade route - if it's new and risky, humans are trying it.

### In the World

Walk through any market town and you'll see humanity's diversity on full display. The tall, pale-haired northerner haggles with a compact, sun-bronzed desert merchant. A mountain trader's weathered face contrasts with the smooth features of a coastal sailor. They speak different dialects, prefer different foods, worship different aspects of the same gods - yet all are unmistakably human in their drive to make something of themselves.

Humans form the backbone of most settlements, from tiny farming hamlets to sprawling cities. They're the farmers whose fields feed nations, the merchants whose caravans connect cultures, the soldiers who garrison walls, the crafters who supply daily needs. Not always the best at any particular skill - an elf will outshoot most human archers, a dwarf will outforge most human smiths - but humans make up for specialization with sheer determination and numbers.

Other races often find humans simultaneously frustrating and fascinating. "They rush everywhere," complains an [elven](../elves/index.md) sage, "never stopping to truly understand." "But they get things done," admits a [dwarven](../dwarves/index.md) smith, "and some of their 'crazy ideas' actually work." To [tribal races](../../monstrous/index.md), humans represent both opportunity and threat - potential trading partners or encroaching settlers, depending on the tribe's experience.

Human settlements welcome most races (well, the enlightened ones at least), making them natural hubs for cross-cultural interaction. The same human town might host a [dwarven](../dwarves/index.md) smith, an [elven](../elves/index.md) [mage](../../../classes/magic/index.md) advisor, a [gnoll](../../monstrous/index.md) trading party, and a [kobold](../../kobolds/index.md) tinker - all doing business in the market square. This openness comes partly from pragmatism - humans need allies - and partly from curiosity. Humans want to know how things work, including people different from themselves.

See [Racial Synergies](../../../systems/character/racial-synergies/index.md) for detailed mechanics.

### Racial Skills

**Skill Pool Tags:** Universal (no restrictions)

Humans receive **3 random skills** from the entire skill library at character creation, with additional skills available at racial milestone levels (10, 25, 50). Unlike other races, humans are not restricted by skill pool tags - they can select from any skill in the game.

**Example Racial Skills:**

| Skill                                                                   | Tags                 | Effect                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| [Ambidexterity](../../../skills/mechanic-unlock/ambidexterity/index.md) | Physical, Combat     | Use both hands equally well               |
| [Iron Will](../../../skills/mechanic-unlock/iron-will/index.md)         | Universal/Mental     | Enhanced resistance to mental effects     |
| [Danger Sense](../../../skills/common/danger-sense/index.md)            | Physical, Universal  | Intuitive warning of threats              |
| [Quick Learner](../../../skills/common/quick-learner/index.md)          | Universal, Knowledge | +10% XP gain for new skills               |
| [Inspiring Leader](../../../skills/tiered/inspiring-leader/index.md)    | Leadership, Social   | Boost ally morale and effectiveness       |
| [Adaptable](../../../skills/index.md)                                   | Universal, Physical  | +50% faster environmental acclimatization |

**Versatile**: Humans can learn any [class](../../../classes/index.md), any [skill](../../../content/skills/index.md), any technique without penalty. Where an [elf](../elves/index.md) struggles with brutish melee or a [dwarf](../dwarves/index.md) wrestles with complex spellcasting, humans simply... do it. This doesn't make them instantly great, but it means no path is closed to them.

**Universal Skill Access**: Unlike other races with restricted racial skill pools, humans draw their 3 starting racial skills from the entire skill library. This reflects human adaptability - one human might get physical combat skills, another magical abilities, a third social talents. No two humans start identically.

**Ambitious**: The same drive that pushes humans to explore and innovate translates to faster learning. They gain [experience](../../../systems/character/index.md) 5% faster than baseline, compounding over a lifetime into significant growth.

**Diplomatic**: Humans have a knack for getting along - or at least, for finding common ground. They start with slightly better [relations](../../../systems/social/factions-reputation/index.md) (+5%) with all races, making that crucial first impression just a bit easier.

## Cultural Notes

### Human Diversity

Unlike other races with relatively unified cultures (even accounting for variants), humans display staggering cultural variety. A mountain human and a coastal human might share more differences than similarities in language, custom, and worldview - yet both will recognize each other as kin in ways they wouldn't with even closely allied elves.

### The Human Paradox

Humans are simultaneously the most accepting and most xenophobic race. A cosmopolitan human city welcomes all enlightened races, while an isolated human village might drive off even other humans from different regions. This inconsistency frustrates other races but stems from humans' strong in-group/out-group dynamics - they just define "us" in wildly different ways depending on their experiences.

### Innovation and Tradition

Human settlements balance innovation and tradition awkwardly. Grandmothers insist "we've always done it this way" while grandchildren experiment with radical new techniques. Unlike dwarven reverence for tradition or elven patience with gradual change, humans argue constantly about whether to preserve or improve, creating dynamic but sometimes unstable cultures.

### The Baseline Perspective

Other races define themselves partly in relation to humans. "Humans are impatient, we are patient." "Humans are brief, we are eternal." "Humans are adaptable, we are specialized." Being the reference point gives humans a strange position - simultaneously ordinary (no special powers) and special (the universal standard).

This makes humans natural diplomats and mediators. When an [elf](../elves/index.md) and a [dwarf](../dwarves/index.md) can't agree, they'll both accept a human arbitrator. When a [gnoll](../../monstrous/index.md) tribe negotiates with a [settlement](../../../systems/world/settlements/index.md), a human representative bridges the gap. Not because humans are wiser or fairer, but because they're neutral ground.
