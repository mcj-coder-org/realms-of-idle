# Humans

> **See [Base Traits](base.md)** for shared racial characteristics, lore, and cultural notes.

## Variants

Human variants reflect environmental adaptation and cultural upbringing rather than genetic differences. A desert-born human raised in the north will retain desert appearance but gain northern environmental bonuses through the innate human Adaptable trait. These bonuses represent learned cultural knowledge and acclimatization, not inherited biology.

### Heartland Human

The baseline human, found in temperate regions across the world. Representing humanity in its most balanced form, heartland humans form the majority of human populations and serve as the default reference for human capabilities. No specialized adaptations, just pure human versatility.

**Key Features:** Pure baseline, no environmental bonuses, maximum flexibility

**[Learn More →](heartland.md)**

### Northern Human

Cold-adapted humans from frozen tundra and icy mountains. Generations in harsh climates have shaped cultures that prize endurance and survival. They tend toward larger builds with more body mass for insulation, though this reflects cultural nutrition and lifestyle rather than genetics.

**Key Features:** +1 END, +15% cold resistance, adapted to freezing conditions

### Desert Human

Heat-adapted humans from arid wastelands and scorching sands. Desert cultures emphasize water conservation, efficient movement, and stamina management. They develop exceptional endurance for their harsh environment, learning to thrive where others merely survive.

**Key Features:** +1 END, +15% heat resistance, +10% stamina efficiency

### Coastal Human

Maritime humans from shorelines, islands, and seafaring cultures. Raised around water, coastal humans develop enhanced coordination for shipboard work and instinctive swimming ability. Their cultures emphasize navigation, fishing, and trade across waterways.

**Key Features:** +1 FIN, enhanced swim speed, navigation bonuses

### Mountain Human

High-altitude humans adapted to thin air and steep terrain. Mountain cultures breed exceptional endurance and altitude tolerance, allowing them to function normally where lowlanders gasp for breath. They navigate treacherous slopes with practiced ease.

**Key Features:** +1 END, altitude adaptation, +5% stamina efficiency

## Important Notes on Human Variants

### Environmental Adaptation vs. Genetics

Human variants represent **cultural upbringing and environmental acclimatization**, not genetic subspecies. A desert human child raised in northern lands will:

- Retain desert physical appearance (darker skin, build, features)
- Gain northern environmental bonuses (cold resistance, endurance)
- Develop northern cultural knowledge and survival skills

The human Adaptable trait allows this flexibility - appearance is inherited, but environmental bonuses reflect where you were **raised and trained**, not where you were born.

### Universal Skill Access

All human variants share humanity's signature trait: **universal skill access**. Unlike other races restricted by skill pool tags, every human can learn any skill from the entire game library. Environmental variants don't change this fundamental human versatility.

### No Tag Restrictions

Humans have **no tag affinities or aversions**. Whether heartland, desert, or mountain, all humans learn all skills at the same rate. The 5% XP bonus applies universally, and no skill type is harder or easier for any human variant.

## Available Classes

Humans have **unrestricted access to all classes** in the game. Every human variant (heartland, northern, desert, coastal, mountain) can pursue any class without limitation:

**Full Class Access**: All 75+ classes across all paths

- Fighter Classes (7 types)
- Channeler Classes (Mage paths, Illusionist, Summoner, Healer, Enchanter)
- Spiritcaller Classes (Shaman and specializations)
- Crafter Classes (9 types)
- Gatherer Classes (7 types)
- Trader Classes (3 types)
- Rogue Classes (3 types)
- Consolidation Classes (hybrid class combinations)

**Advantage**: Human versatility extends to class selection. Your choice of class is never constrained by your racial variant.
