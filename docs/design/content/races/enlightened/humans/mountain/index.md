# Mountain Human

> **See [Base Traits](base/index.md)** for shared human characteristics.

## Overview

Mountain humans dwell in high-altitude regions where the air grows thin and terrain turns treacherous. Raised among peaks, cliffs, and mountain passes, they develop exceptional endurance for functioning in oxygen-poor conditions and instinctive navigation of steep, dangerous terrain. Their cultures emphasize climbing, altitude tolerance, and the unique challenges of vertical living.

Mountain settlements cling to defensible positions, sheltered valleys, or high passes controlling valuable trade routes. Architecture accounts for steep slopes, avalanche risk, and extreme weather. Social structures often feature mountain guide traditions, climbing expertise passed through generations, and territorial control of passes and peaks. The mountains provide both protection and isolation.

Mountain humans who descend to lowlands often find the thick air overwhelming and flat terrain disorienting. "Where's the horizon?" is a common mountain complaint about lowland views - they're used to seeing for miles from elevation.

## Variant Mechanics

### Attribute Modifiers

| Attribute | Modifier | Note                   |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| Strength  | +0       | Baseline               |
| Finesse   | +0       | Baseline               |
| Endurance | +1       | Altitude-adapted lungs |
| Wit       | +0       | Baseline               |
| Charisma  | +0       | Baseline               |
| Awareness | +0       | Baseline               |
| Patience  | +0       | Baseline               |

**High-Altitude Conditioning**: The +1 Endurance reflects physiological adaptation to thin air and cultural conditioning for climbing and vertical terrain. Mountain humans develop exceptional cardiovascular efficiency and physical resilience.

### Environmental Adaptation

| Environment | Adaptation          | Effect                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Altitude    | No penalties        | Function normally at any altitude          |
| Mountains   | Native              | Perfect comfort in steep, high terrain     |
| Temperate   | Standard            | Comfortable at sea level (air feels thick) |
| Cold        | Moderate resistance | Mountains are cold - natural tolerance     |
| Climbing    | Enhanced            | +20% climbing speed, reduced stamina cost  |

**Altitude Adaptation**: Mountain humans suffer no penalties from thin air at any elevation. Where lowlanders gasp and struggle above certain altitudes, mountain humans function normally. This is physiological - larger lung capacity, more efficient oxygen processing.

**Climbing Proficiency**: Lifelong exposure to vertical terrain makes mountain humans natural climbers. They ascend faster, tire less quickly, and instinctively find secure holds.

### Variant Features

**Stamina Efficiency**: +5% stamina pool or regeneration. Mountain life teaches efficient movement in challenging terrain. Every step is planned, every breath optimized.

**Sure-Footed**: Reduced penalties for unstable or steep terrain. Mountain humans rarely slip, instinctively balance, and navigate dangerous ground confidently.

**Weather Sense**: Mountain humans read weather patterns with uncanny accuracy - crucial when storms can turn deadly in minutes at elevation. They predict changes hours in advance.

**Compact, Powerful Build**: Mountain humans tend toward compact, muscular builds optimized for climbing and functioning in thin air. This isn't a mechanical size change but reflects cultural body composition.

## Roleplay Considerations

### Cultural Identity

Mountain humans identify with elevation, isolation, and endurance through adversity. They take pride in surviving where lowlanders cannot, viewing altitude as a natural fortress and test of worthiness. "The peaks choose who climbs" reflects their respect for their environment's selective danger.

Their cultures often feature:

- Mountain guide traditions and climbing expertise
- Control of mountain passes as economic and military advantage
- Coming-of-age climbs to significant peaks
- Respect for avalanche risk and mountain hazards
- Isolated, self-sufficient communities
- Territorial attitudes toward their peaks

### Appearance

Mountain humans feature:

- Weathered, wind-burned skin
- Powerful, compact builds with broad chests (lung capacity)
- Light to medium skin tones (high altitude UV exposure)
- Practical, layered clothing for variable altitude conditions
- Climbing gear as everyday equipment
- Features reflecting diverse mountain ethnicities

### Worldview

Growing up at elevation, mountain humans develop respect for environmental power and the value of preparation. "Respect the mountain" isn't poetic - it's practical survival advice. Mountains kill the careless, so mountain cultures emphasize caution, planning, and humility before natural forces.

This creates pragmatic, cautious cultures that value proven knowledge over innovation. "That path has killed others" outweighs "but it's faster." Yet they also value courage and endurance - surviving mountains requires both respect and determination.

### Relations with Other Variants

Mountain humans view lowlanders with mild pity - "They've never truly breathed thin air." Coastal humans they find incomprehensible - "Why live where you can't see threats approaching?" Northern humans they respect as fellow harsh-environment survivors, though mountain culture sees climbing as harder than mere cold tolerance.

They get along best with dwarves, whose mountain holds create cultural overlap and mutual respect for stone and elevation.

## Gameplay Considerations

### Best For

- **Mountain Campaigns**: Alpine exploration, cliff-side dungeons, high-altitude adventures
- **Endurance Builds**: Characters valuing toughness, stamina, and sustained effort
- **Climbing Focus**: Scouts, rangers, anyone needing vertical mobility
- **Defensive Settings**: Campaigns featuring mountain fortifications and passes
- **Survival Challenges**: High-altitude environmental hazards and obstacles

### Synergies

**Altitude Adaptation**: Invaluable when elevation matters. Climb mountains, explore high peaks, and pursue enemies into thin air without penalty.

**Climbing Proficiency**: The climbing bonuses synergize with exploration-focused classes (rangers, scouts) and make vertical terrain an advantage rather than obstacle.

**Endurance Bonus**: The +1 Endurance stacks with endurance-focused builds, creating tough characters who excel in prolonged challenges.

**Stamina Efficiency**: The +5% stamina bonus combines with altitude adaptation for exceptional performance in challenging terrain.

### Limitations

**Lowland Campaigns**: If the campaign stays at sea level, altitude adaptation becomes largely irrelevant. Primarily just the +1 Endurance and minor bonuses remain.

**Specialized Bonus**: Climbing and altitude advantages only matter in relevant terrain. Flat campaigns or underground dungeons don't utilize these strengths.

**Cultural Isolation**: Mountain cultures' isolation can create roleplaying challenges in cosmopolitan settings. (Interesting but potentially limiting.)

## Example Characters

### Mountain Guide

Leads expeditions through treacherous passes, knowing every safe route and deadly pitfall. Expert climber, weather reader, and invaluable in alpine terrain.

### Peak Monastery Monk

Trained in a high-altitude monastery, combining martial discipline with altitude advantage. Pursues enemies into thin air where they cannot follow.

### Pass Warden

Guards a strategic mountain pass, controlling access and collecting tolls. Combines combat skill with terrain knowledge, making the mountains their weapon.

### Highland Herder

Tends livestock in high meadows, moving seasonally between altitudes. Brings practical mountain knowledge and adaptability to adventuring.
