# Heartland Human

> **See [Base Traits](base/index.md)** for shared human characteristics.

## Overview

Heartland humans represent humanity in its most balanced, versatile form. Found in temperate regions with moderate climates, they form the majority of human populations and serve as the universal baseline for human capabilities. No specialized environmental adaptations, no regional bonuses - just pure human flexibility and adaptability.

Most human settlements, from farming villages to trading cities, consist primarily of heartland humans. They thrive in the comfortable middle ground between environmental extremes, building diverse cultures focused on agriculture, trade, craftsmanship, and community rather than environmental survival.

## Variant Mechanics

### Attribute Modifiers

| Attribute | Modifier | Note                        |
| --------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| Strength  | +0       | Baseline reference          |
| Finesse   | +0       | No modifications            |
| Endurance | +0       | Standard human endurance    |
| Wit       | +0       | Standard human intelligence |
| Charisma  | +0       | Standard human charisma     |
| Awareness | +0       | Standard human awareness    |
| Patience  | +0       | Standard human patience     |

**Pure Baseline**: Heartland humans have no attribute modifiers, representing pure human potential without environmental specialization.

### Environmental Adaptation

| Environment | Adaptation | Effect                            |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| Temperate   | Native     | Full comfort in moderate climates |
| Cold        | None       | Standard cold tolerance           |
| Heat        | None       | Standard heat tolerance           |
| Altitude    | None       | Standard altitude tolerance       |
| Aquatic     | None       | Standard swimming ability         |

**No Specialization**: Heartland humans lack specialized environmental bonuses but also have no weaknesses. They function at standard human baseline in all environments.

### Variant Features

**Universal Adaptability**: Like all humans, heartland variants have access to the full skill library with no restrictions. The lack of specialized bonuses is offset by complete flexibility in skill selection and class choice.

**Cultural Diversity**: Heartland human cultures vary enormously - from agricultural communities to mercantile cities to military kingdoms. This cultural variety means heartland humans can represent almost any background or profession without environmental constraints.

**Population Majority**: Most human settlements consist primarily of heartland variants, making them the "default" human experience. Other variants often visit heartland regions, but heartland humans form the stable core of human civilization.

## Roleplay Considerations

### Cultural Identity

Heartland humans define themselves through community, profession, and achievement rather than environmental adaptation. A heartland farmer, merchant, or soldier identifies with their role and hometown rather than survival in harsh conditions. Their stories focus on human ambition, innovation, and social dynamics rather than environmental challenges.

### Appearance

Heartland humans show the widest variety of physical appearances - medium builds, varied skin tones, diverse features. They're "average" in every sense, representing the middle of human physical expression without the distinctive traits of specialized variants.

### Worldview

Growing up in comfortable climates, heartland humans often take environmental stability for granted. They build for the long term, invest in elaborate agriculture and infrastructure, and focus on cultural and economic development. Other variants sometimes view them as "soft," while heartland humans see themselves as civilized rather than merely adapted.

### Relations with Variants

Heartland humans form the baseline that other variants compare themselves against. Northern humans might be "hardier," desert humans "more efficient," but heartland humans represent the standard. This creates a subtle dynamic where heartland culture is seen as default and variants as specialized - which can be both privilege and limitation.

## Gameplay Considerations

### Best For

- **Pure Flexibility**: No bonuses means no specialization pressure - build any character concept
- **Urban Settings**: Most human cities are temperate heartland regions
- **Standard Campaigns**: Default choice when regional mechanics aren't relevant
- **Balanced Characters**: No attribute modifiers mean balanced, predictable builds
- **Role Freedom**: No environmental focus means profession/class defines the character

### Synergies

**Any Class**: With no specialized bonuses, heartland humans work equally well with any class or skill focus. Pure human versatility.

**Universal Skills**: Access to entire skill library without regional flavor constraints. Choose skills based on character concept, not environmental adaptation.

**Party Balance**: As the baseline variant, heartland humans fit any party composition without environmental overlap or gaps.

### Limitations

**No Bonuses**: The price of versatility is lack of specialized advantages. Environmental specialists will outperform in their niches.

**No Resistance**: Standard tolerance to all environmental hazards means heartland humans need gear or magic for extreme conditions.

**Cultural "Softness"**: Narratively, heartland humans may seem less impressive than variants with obvious survival adaptations.
