# Coastal Human

> **See [Base Traits](base.md)** for shared human characteristics.

## Overview

Coastal humans call the shorelines, islands, and seafaring cultures of the realm home. Raised around water from birth, they develop enhanced coordination for shipboard work, instinctive swimming ability, and deep understanding of maritime conditions. Their cultures emphasize navigation, fishing, trade across waterways, and the rhythms of tides and seasons.

Coastal settlements range from fishing villages to major port cities, all oriented toward the sea. Architecture accounts for salt air corrosion, storm surge, and tidal flooding. Social structures often feature maritime guilds, fishing cooperatives, and merchant marine organizations. The sea provides both livelihood and threat - coastal humans respect water's power while making their living from it.

Coastal humans who travel inland often feel claustrophobic away from open horizons and disoriented without tidal rhythms. "Landlocked" is both a descriptive term and a vague insult in coastal culture.

## Variant Mechanics

### Attribute Modifiers

| Attribute | Modifier | Note                  |
| --------- | -------- | --------------------- |
| Strength  | +0       | Baseline              |
| Finesse   | +1       | Enhanced coordination |
| Endurance | +0       | Baseline              |
| Wit       | +0       | Baseline              |
| Charisma  | +0       | Baseline              |
| Awareness | +0       | Baseline              |
| Patience  | +0       | Baseline              |

**Maritime Coordination**: The +1 Finesse reflects lifelong training in balance, coordination, and precise movement. Working on ships, navigating slippery docks, and managing ropes and rigging develops exceptional hand-eye coordination and body control.

### Environmental Adaptation

| Environment | Adaptation        | Effect                                   |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Aquatic     | Enhanced swimming | 50% increased swim speed, water comfort  |
| Coastal     | Native            | Perfect function in maritime conditions  |
| Temperate   | Standard          | Comfortable inland                       |
| Storms      | Sea legs          | Reduced penalties for rough water/storms |
| Altitude    | None              | Standard altitude tolerance              |

**Water Adaptation**: Coastal humans swim faster and more efficiently than heartland variants. They can swim for extended periods without exhaustion, hold their breath longer, and instinctively read water currents.

**Storm Resistance**: Years on the water teach balance and stability in rough conditions. Coastal humans suffer reduced penalties for unstable footing, whether ship decks or wet surfaces.

### Variant Features

**Navigation Expertise**: Coastal humans read weather patterns, water conditions, and celestial navigation intuitively. They gain significant bonuses to maritime navigation, weather prediction, and route planning across water.

**Shipboard Proficiency**: Bonus to all ship-related skills - rigging work, sail management, deck operations. Coastal humans are simply more effective aboard vessels through cultural familiarity.

**Lean Build**: Coastal humans tend toward lean, agile builds optimized for climbing rigging and moving in confined shipboard spaces. This isn't a mechanical size change but reflects cultural body composition.

**Tide Sense**: Coastal humans instinctively track tidal rhythms and understand their impact. They know when harbors will be accessible, when beaches will be exposed, when currents will be favorable.

## Roleplay Considerations

### Cultural Identity

Coastal humans identify with the sea, freedom, and movement. They take pride in their maritime skills and often view landlocked cultures as provincial and limited. "The horizon calls" is a common coastal saying reflecting their wanderlust and connection to trade and travel.

Their cultures often feature:

- Maritime traditions and sea-related celebrations
- Strong merchant and trading cultures
- Navigation as fundamental education
- Fishing and maritime resource management
- Superstitions and traditions around water and weather
- Openness to foreign cultures (ports see many visitors)

### Appearance

Coastal humans feature:

- Sun-tanned skin with weathered texture
- Hair bleached lighter by salt and sun
- Lean, athletic builds with developed upper body
- Sea-colored eyes (blues, greens, grays) culturally valued
- Practical clothing resistant to salt and water
- Jewelry and decoration featuring maritime themes

### Worldview

Growing up with the sea's moods, coastal humans develop philosophical perspectives on change, adaptation, and accepting what they cannot control. "You can't fight the tide" reflects their pragmatic acceptance of forces beyond human power. Yet they also value skill, preparedness, and knowledge - the sea rewards competence and punishes carelessness.

This creates cultures that balance acceptance and effort. Prepare well, sail skillfully, but accept that sometimes the sea decides. This worldview makes coastal humans adaptable in varied situations while remaining grounded in practical reality.

### Relations with Other Variants

Coastal humans find desert and mountain variants interesting but alien - landlocked existence seems impossibly limited. Heartland humans they view as stable but boring - "They've never seen the horizon change." Northern humans they respect for toughness but pity for their frozen, static environment. "The sea may be harsh, but at least it moves."

## Gameplay Considerations

### Best For

- **Maritime Campaigns**: Naval adventures, island hopping, pirate-themed games
- **Finesse Builds**: Rogues, rangers, any class valuing coordination and agility
- **Exploration Settings**: Campaigns featuring significant water travel
- **Trade/Social Focus**: Coastal trading cultures and port city intrigue
- **Mobile Playstyles**: Characters who value movement and adaptability

### Synergies

**Enhanced Swimming**: Invaluable for water-based adventures. Exploration, combat, and travel involving water become significantly easier.

**Finesse Bonus**: The +1 Finesse synergizes with finesse-focused classes (rogues, rangers, duelists) and skills requiring coordination, creating highly precise characters.

**Navigation Skills**: Cultural bonuses make coastal humans excellent scouts, guides, and explorers in maritime or coastal environments.

### Limitations

**Landlocked Campaigns**: If the campaign features minimal water, many coastal bonuses become irrelevant. Primarily just the +1 Finesse remains mechanically significant.

**Cultural Focus**: Strong maritime identity can create roleplaying challenges in inland settings. (Narratively interesting but potentially limiting.)

**Specialized Bonus**: Swimming and navigation bonuses only matter when water is present. Desert or mountain campaigns may not utilize these advantages.

## Example Characters

### Merchant Captain

Commands a trading vessel between port cities, combining navigation expertise, mercantile savvy, and leadership. Equally comfortable negotiating trade deals and navigating storms.

### Island Scout

Explores archipelagos and coastlines, mapping routes and investigating rumors. Expert swimmer, skilled navigator, and adaptable explorer comfortable anywhere near water.

### Harbor Guard

Protects a major port city from pirates, smugglers, and maritime threats. Combines combat training with maritime knowledge, equally effective on docks or decks.

### Fisher-Turned-Adventurer

Left a fishing village seeking fortune, bringing practical maritime skills and common-sense pragmatism to adventuring. Underestimated by those who don't realize how dangerous commercial fishing can be.
