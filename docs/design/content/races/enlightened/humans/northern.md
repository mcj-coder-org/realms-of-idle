# Northern Human

> **See [Base Traits](base.md)** for shared human characteristics.

## Overview

Northern humans hail from the frozen tundra, icy mountains, and snow-covered forests at the world's extremes. Shaped by generations in harsh cold climates, their cultures emphasize survival, endurance, and communal resilience. They tend toward larger, more robust builds - not through genetics, but through cultural nutrition practices and physical lifestyles that build mass for insulation.

Northern settlements cluster around reliable resources: hot springs, sheltered valleys, or proven hunting grounds. Architecture emphasizes insulation and heat retention. Social structures stress cooperation and shared survival - in the frozen north, individualism kills. Northern humans who travel south often find temperate climates uncomfortably warm and lowland cultures bewilderingly individualistic.

## Variant Mechanics

### Attribute Modifiers

| Attribute | Modifier | Note                    |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------------- |
| Strength  | +0       | Baseline                |
| Finesse   | +0       | No change               |
| Endurance | +1       | Enhanced cold tolerance |
| Wit       | +0       | Baseline                |
| Charisma  | +0       | Baseline                |
| Awareness | +0       | Baseline                |
| Patience  | +0       | Baseline                |

**Hardy Build**: The +1 Endurance reflects cultural conditioning, nutrition, and lifestyle that builds exceptional physical resilience. Northern humans are simply tougher through upbringing in harsh conditions.

### Environmental Adaptation

| Environment | Adaptation       | Effect                             |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Cold        | +15% resistance  | Reduced cold damage and exposure   |
| Temperate   | Standard         | Comfortable (though warm)          |
| Heat        | Mild discomfort  | Slight penalties in extreme heat   |
| Altitude    | None             | Standard altitude tolerance        |
| Aquatic     | Ice water talent | Swim in near-freezing water safely |

**Cold Resistance**: Northern humans function normally in temperatures that would threaten heartland humans. Frostbite, hypothermia, and cold-based attacks affect them less severely.

**Cultural Adaptation**: The cold resistance represents learned survival techniques, specialized clothing knowledge, and physiological acclimatization rather than genetic immunity.

### Variant Features

**Larger Build**: Northern humans average taller and heavier than heartland variants. This isn't a mechanical size category change but reflects cultural body composition - more muscle mass, more body fat for insulation. Narratively, they're visibly larger and more physically imposing.

**Survival Focus**: Northern cultures teach survival skills from childhood. Ice fishing, shelter building, reading weather patterns, and recognizing avalanche risks become second nature. These translate to Knowledge skill bonuses related to cold environments.

**Communal Resilience**: Northern settlements stress interdependence over independence. Northern humans gain cultural bonuses to group activities in harsh conditions - coordinated hunts, rescue operations, shared labor.

## Roleplay Considerations

### Cultural Identity

Northern humans identify strongly with survival, community, and endurance. They take pride in thriving where others would perish, viewing hardship as a crucible that reveals character. "Soft southerners" is a common northern dismissal of those from temperate climes.

Their cultures often feature:

- Shared food stores and communal resource management
- Coming-of-age trials involving survival challenges
- Strong storytelling traditions (long winter nights)
- Emphasis on practical skills over abstract knowledge
- Distrust of elaborate social hierarchies (survival equalizes)

### Appearance

Northern humans feature:

- Pale to ruddy skin (limited sun exposure)
- Light hair colors (blonde, red, white-blonde)
- Taller, broader builds with more body mass
- Weathered features from cold and wind
- Practical, layered clothing even indoors

### Worldview

Growing up in constant environmental challenge, northern humans view comfort as potential weakness and luxury as dangerous softness. They respect competence, endurance, and reliability. Elaborate manners or social games strike them as frivolous - when blizzards kill, pretense seems absurd.

This doesn't make them crude or stupid. Northern cultures produce sophisticated oral literature, intricate survival knowledge, and nuanced understanding of group dynamics. They simply prioritize differently than temperate cultures.

### Relations with Other Variants

Northern humans often clash culturally with heartland and coastal variants. "You've never been truly cold," is a common northern complaint about southerners. "You're blunt to the point of rudeness," is a common southern complaint about northerners. Desert humans, fellow environmental specialists, earn grudging northern respect as "at least they know real hardship."

## Gameplay Considerations

### Best For

- **Cold Campaigns**: Arctic exploration, frozen dungeons, ice-themed adventures
- **Endurance Builds**: Tanks, warriors, any role valuing high HP and toughness
- **Survival Settings**: Harsh campaign worlds where environmental hazards matter
- **Hardy Characters**: Concepts built around physical resilience and determination
- **Group-Focused Play**: Characters who value party cohesion and teamwork

### Synergies

**Cold Resistance**: Invaluable in frozen regions. Face frost giants, ice elementals, and blizzards with significant advantages.

**Endurance Bonus**: The +1 Endurance stacks with endurance-focused classes (warriors, knights) and skills, creating exceptionally tough characters.

**Environmental Skills**: Cultural knowledge bonuses synergize with survival-focused classes (rangers, hunters) or wilderness campaigns.

### Limitations

**Heat Vulnerability**: Mild penalties in extreme heat environments. Desert campaigns may require gear or magic to compensate.

**Cultural Bluntness**: Northern directness can complicate social encounters in diplomatic campaigns. (Narratively interesting but potentially challenging.)

**Specialized Bonus**: Cold resistance only matters when cold is relevant. In temperate campaigns, effectively just the +1 Endurance remains.

## Example Characters

### Tundra Ranger

A northern scout who tracks game across frozen wastes, equally comfortable in howling blizzards or silent snowfall. Expert in survival and cold-weather warfare.

### Shield Maiden

A warrior from a communal northern settlement, trained to defend her people against ice-adapted monsters and rival tribes. Values honor, endurance, and protecting the group.

### Frost Trader

A merchant who travels between northern settlements and temperate cities, profiting from geographic arbitrage while bridging cultural gaps. Tough enough to survive the journey, shrewd enough to profit from it.
