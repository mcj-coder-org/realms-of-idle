# Desert Human

> **See [Base Traits](base/index.md)** for shared human characteristics.

## Overview

Desert humans thrive in scorching wastelands, arid steppes, and sun-baked badlands where water is precious and shade is salvation. Shaped by generations in extreme heat and resource scarcity, their cultures emphasize efficiency, conservation, and stamina management. They've learned not just to survive the desert but to flourish in it, building sophisticated civilizations around oases, underground aquifers, and careful resource management.

Desert settlements cluster around reliable water sources and trade routes. Architecture emphasizes cooling through shade, ventilation, and thermal mass. Social structures often feature complex water rights and resource allocation systems - in the desert, control of water is power. Desert humans who travel to temperate regions often find the humidity oppressive and the casual water waste shocking.

## Variant Mechanics

### Attribute Modifiers

| Attribute | Modifier | Note                     |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| Strength  | +0       | Baseline                 |
| Finesse   | +0       | Baseline                 |
| Endurance | +1       | Heat-hardened resilience |
| Wit       | +0       | Baseline                 |
| Charisma  | +0       | Baseline                 |
| Awareness | +0       | Baseline                 |
| Patience  | +0       | Baseline                 |

**Desert-Hardened**: The +1 Endurance reflects cultural conditioning and physiological adaptation to extreme heat, dehydration risk, and harsh environmental demands. Desert humans develop exceptional physical resilience through necessity.

### Environmental Adaptation

| Environment | Adaptation       | Effect                               |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Heat        | +15% resistance  | Reduced heat damage and exposure     |
| Arid        | Water efficiency | Require 25% less water for hydration |
| Temperate   | Standard         | Comfortable (though humid)           |
| Cold        | Mild discomfort  | Slight penalties in extreme cold     |
| Altitude    | None             | Standard altitude tolerance          |

**Heat Resistance**: Desert humans function normally in temperatures that would threaten heartland humans. Heatstroke, dehydration, and fire-based attacks affect them less severely.

**Water Conservation**: Desert-adapted physiology and learned techniques mean desert humans can operate on less water. This isn't magic - they sweat more efficiently, move during cooler hours, and know hydration management instinctively.

### Variant Features

**Stamina Efficiency**: +10% stamina pool or stamina regeneration. Desert survival teaches efficient movement and energy conservation. Desert humans waste no effort, making their stamina last longer than equivalent heartland humans.

**Heat Sense**: Desert humans read temperature changes, sun position, and thermal conditions intuitively. They know when to seek shade, when to move, when to rest. This translates to environmental awareness bonuses in hot climates.

**Compact Build**: Desert humans tend toward lean, efficient builds. Less mass to heat, less water needed, more efficient cooling. This isn't a mechanical size change but reflects cultural body composition optimized for heat management.

## Roleplay Considerations

### Cultural Identity

Desert humans identify with efficiency, resourcefulness, and survival through intelligence rather than brute force. They take pride in thriving with minimal resources, viewing waste as both practical failure and moral weakness. "The desert teaches or kills" is a common desert saying, and those it teaches become formidable.

Their cultures often feature:

- Elaborate water rights and resource sharing systems
- Hospitality traditions (sharing scarce resources with travelers)
- Navigation expertise (reading stars, dunes, wind patterns)
- Emphasis on memory and oral preservation (paper doesn't last in heat/sand)
- Respect for scarcity and conservation

### Appearance

Desert humans feature:

- Deep tan to dark brown skin (sun protection)
- Dark hair and eyes (sun protection)
- Lean, efficient builds with minimal excess mass
- Weathered features from sun and wind exposure
- Practical, loose clothing for heat management and sun protection

### Worldview

Growing up with constant resource scarcity, desert humans view abundance with suspicion and waste with horror. A heartland human leaving water running would appall a desert human - that's life itself being carelessly squandered. They respect efficiency, planning, and those who thrive through intelligence.

This doesn't make them misers or joyless. Desert cultures produce sophisticated poetry, intricate textile arts, and refined cuisine that maximizes flavor with minimal ingredients. They simply celebrate differently than cultures where resources are cheap.

### Relations with Other Variants

Desert humans often find heartland and coastal variants wasteful and short-sighted. "You take your comfort for granted," is a common desert observation about temperate dwellers. Northern humans, fellow environmental specialists, earn grudging desert respect - "At least they understand hardship." The mutual respect between desert and northern humans creates interesting dynamics despite their opposite adaptations.

## Gameplay Considerations

### Best For

- **Desert Campaigns**: Arid exploration, wasteland survival, heat-themed adventures
- **Stamina Builds**: Classes/playstyles that rely on stamina management and efficiency
- **Survival Settings**: Resource-scarce campaigns where efficiency matters
- **Endurance Characters**: Concepts built around resilience and conservation
- **Efficient Playstyles**: Players who value doing more with less

### Synergies

**Heat Resistance**: Invaluable in desert regions, volcanic environments, or fire-heavy combat. Face fire elementals and heat hazards with significant advantages.

**Stamina Efficiency**: The +10% stamina bonus synergizes with stamina-intensive classes (warriors, rangers) and long-duration activities (exploration, extended combat).

**Endurance Bonus**: The +1 Endurance stacks with endurance-focused builds, creating tough, resilient characters who last longer in challenging conditions.

### Limitations

**Cold Vulnerability**: Mild penalties in extreme cold environments. Arctic campaigns may require gear or magic to compensate.

**Resource Focus**: Bonuses tied to specific environmental conditions. In temperate campaigns with easy resources, primarily just the +1 Endurance and stamina efficiency remain relevant.

**Cultural Clash**: Desert emphasis on conservation can create roleplaying tension with wasteful party members or abundance-focused cultures.

## Example Characters

### Desert Scout

A nomadic guide who knows the wastes like heartland humans know their village. Expert navigator, efficient survivor, and invaluable in hostile terrain.

### Oasis Merchant

A trader who manages caravans between scattered desert settlements, profiting from geographic isolation while providing vital supply lines. Tough enough to survive the journey, clever enough to profit from scarcity.

### Sand Warrior

A guardian from a desert city-state, trained in efficient, devastating combat that ends fights quickly to conserve stamina in brutal heat. Values precision over prolonged brawling.
