# Lizardfolk

## Lore

### Origin

Lizardfolk civilizations flourished when humans still huddled in caves. The great stone pyramids of the Scaled Kingdoms predate the oldest human structures by millennia, their precise astronomical alignments still baffling scholars. Lizardfolk didn't conquer or expand; they built, observed, calculated, and endured. While younger races rose and fell like tides, lizardfolk watched with patient, unblinking eyes.

The swamps, marshes, and river deltas of the world belong to lizardfolk. They built their cities where water and land interweave - stone pyramids rising from still waters, canal systems connecting distant settlements, temple complexes designed to flood and drain with seasonal precision. These cities don't sprawl like human settlements or delve like dwarven holds; they integrate with their environment, working with water's rhythm rather than against it.

Lizardfolk religion centers on ancestor worship and celestial observation. The dead are mummified and entombed in sacred pyramids, where their spirits offer guidance to living priests. Star patterns guide planting, building, and major decisions - not from mystical belief but from empirical observation spanning millennia. Lizardfolk know which stars herald rain, which mark planting season, which signal dangerous storm periods. This knowledge makes their civilization stable, predictable, and maddeningly resistant to change.

Cold-blooded physiology shapes lizardfolk culture profoundly. They think slowly but thoroughly, preferring calculation over impulse. Their emotional expression is subtle - a shift in scale color here, a tail movement there - creating the impression (to warm-blooded races) that lizardfolk are cold and unfeeling. This is profoundly wrong; lizardfolk feel deeply but express subtly, finding mammalian emotional displays excessive and somewhat undignified.

### In the World

Lizardfolk city-states maintain independence through isolation and self-sufficiency. They trade with other races - exotic swamp resources, ancient knowledge, exceptional stonework - but don't need outside goods to survive. This gives them negotiating power; they can simply wait decades for better terms, outlasting impatient [human](../humans/index.md) merchants who need deals _now_.

Daily life in a lizardfolk [settlement](../../../systems/world/settlements/index.md) follows rhythms set centuries ago. The morning sun warms scales; work begins. Midday heat brings rest and meditation. Evening coolness resumes activity. Night belongs to study, contemplation, and observation of the stars. This schedule never varies; a lizardfolk knows exactly what they'll do on any given day for years ahead, and finds this predictability comforting rather than boring.

Other races find lizardfolk unsettling. Those unblinking stares feel judgmental (they're not; lizardfolk don't blink as much). That measured, emotionless speech pattern seems cold (it's just how they talk). The patient silences feel awkward (lizardfolk are thinking; why interrupt thought with unnecessary sound?). Yet those who learn to read subtle lizardfolk cues discover surprising warmth and even humor beneath the scaled exterior.

Lizardfolk integrate poorly into warm-blooded [settlements](../../../systems/world/settlements/index.md). The temperature preferences alone cause problems - lizardfolk need warmth that makes [humans](../humans/index.md) sweat. The pace of business exhausts them; why must humans decide everything _today_? The emotional displays confuse and overwhelm. Lizardfolk visiting human cities usually stay briefly, conduct business efficiently, and return home gratefully.

However, [humans](../humans/index.md) who adapt to lizardfolk pace find valuable partners. A lizardfolk [merchant](../../../classes/trade/index.md) might take months to agree on terms but then honor those terms absolutely for decades. A lizardfolk scholar might ponder your question for weeks before delivering a comprehensive, thoroughly-considered answer. A lizardfolk craftsperson works slowly but produces flawless results. The key is accepting that lizardfolk simply operate on a different timescale.

The greatest misunderstanding about lizardfolk is assuming their calm means they don't care. They care tremendously - about legacy, about proper order, about their ancestors' judgment. They simply express care through patient action rather than passionate outcry. A lizardfolk won't shout about injustice; they'll spend twenty years methodically building a case and implementing solutions. To them, this is obviously more effective than yelling.

### Common Lizardfolk Traits

**Cold Blooded:** Lizardfolk are ectothermic, relying on external heat sources to regulate body temperature. This grants +20% heat tolerance, making them comfortable in temperatures that would exhaust warm-blooded races. However, they suffer -20% cold tolerance, becoming uncomfortable below 60°F and dangerously sluggish below 40°F. Temperature directly affects their cognitive function - a cold lizardfolk thinks slower and makes poorer decisions.

**Patient Mind:** Centuries of methodical civilization have shaped lizardfolk cognition. They gain +10% effectiveness on skills requiring sustained focus - research, meditation, precision [crafting](../../../systems/crafting/index.md). Where other races might rush and make errors, lizardfolk take their time and achieve perfection.

**Alien Perspective:** Lizardfolk emotional subtlety makes them resistant to emotional manipulation (+15% charm resistance) but equally poor at charming others (-15% effectiveness using charm-based skills). They simply don't process or project emotions the way warm-blooded races do.

**Tail Balance:** A powerful tail provides exceptional stability. Lizardfolk gain +20% resistance to knockdown effects and maintain balance on unstable surfaces (narrow beams, swaying boats, ice) far better than bipedal races lacking this natural counterweight.

## Cultural Notes

### The Long View

Lizardfolk think in generations. A building project might span fifty years; they'll wait. A diplomatic negotiation might take decades; they're patient. This long-view planning produces incredibly stable societies but makes rapid response to crises nearly impossible. By the time lizardfolk consensus forms, the crisis might have resolved itself - or become catastrophic.

Young lizardfolk sometimes chafe at this pace, wanting to act _now_. Elders respond that haste leads to error, and besides, what's the rush? This generational tension mirrors human/elf cultural gaps, but compressed into a single race.

### Ancestor Guidance

Lizardfolk don't worship ancestors as gods but consult them as advisors. Mummified remains rest in sacred pyramids, where priests perform divination rituals to seek ancestral wisdom. To outsiders this seems like necromancy; to lizardfolk it's simply consulting elders who've passed on but still possess valuable experience.

This practice creates deep continuity - decisions made today consider advice from those who lived centuries ago. It also creates conservatism; ancestors favor what worked in their time, which may not suit current situations.

### The Emotion Question

Do lizardfolk feel emotions? Absolutely. They love, grieve, fear, and hope as deeply as any race. They simply express differently. A devastated lizardfolk might seem calm to humans; a joyful lizardfolk might display only subtle scale brightening. This leads to the harmful stereotype that lizardfolk are unfeeling calculators.

Lizardfolk who interact regularly with mammals learn to exaggerate their expressions and vocalizations, essentially translating their feelings into mammalian "language." It feels artificial - like constantly shouting when a whisper would suffice - but it prevents misunderstandings.

### Scale Patterns and Color

Lizardfolk scales display subtle colors and patterns that convey meaning to other lizardfolk. Bright throat scales might signal aggression or courtship (context matters). Darkened back scales suggest illness or distress. Shimmering patterns indicate contentment. These signals are unconscious, making lizardfolk terrible liars - their scales betray them.

To non-lizardfolk, these signals are invisible or misread, contributing to the sense that lizardfolk are inscrutable. Learning to read scale patterns is a scholarly pursuit among diplomats who regularly work with lizardfolk cities.

### Temperature and Cognition

Cold weather doesn't just make lizardfolk uncomfortable - it slows their thinking. A lizardfolk in frigid conditions becomes literally more sluggish mentally, making poor decisions through dulled cognition. They know this and compensate by avoiding cold, warming themselves artificially, or simply not conducting important business when chilled.

This creates practical problems in mixed settlements. A winter negotiation might see human and dwarven representatives functioning normally while the lizardfolk delegate struggles with basic reasoning. Wise councils schedule important meetings in warm seasons or heated rooms.

### Preservation Through Isolation

Lizardfolk civilization endures partly through selective engagement. They don't expand aggressively, don't seek to convert others to their ways, don't interfere in other races' affairs. This isolation preserves their culture but also limits their influence. In a world of active, expanding races, lizardfolk remain steady islands of ancient tradition.

Some young lizardfolk question whether preservation alone is sufficient. Shouldn't they adapt, engage, change with the world? Elders counter that civilizations that chase every new trend don't last millennia. The debate continues, slowly, as befits lizardfolk pace.

### Humor and Philosophy

Lizardfolk possess a sophisticated philosophical tradition and a dry sense of humor that translates poorly. A lizardfolk joke might take five minutes to set up and deliver a punchline so subtle only other lizardfolk catch it. Their humor tends toward wordplay, logical absurdities, and observations about the foolishness of haste - none of which lands well with audiences expecting quick wit.

Lizardfolk philosophers explore questions of time, permanence, change, and legacy. Their great works are carved in stone, ensuring future generations will ponder the same questions. To lizardfolk, this continuity of thought across centuries represents civilization's highest achievement.
