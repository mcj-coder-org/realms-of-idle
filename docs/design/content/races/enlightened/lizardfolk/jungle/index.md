# Jungle Lizardfolk

> **Parent Race:** [Lizardfolk](base.md)

## Variant Overview

Jungle Lizardfolk adapted to dense forest canopy, becoming the most elusive and mysterious of all lizardfolk variants. They developed camouflage scales that shift to match their surroundings and climbing ability that lets them move through three-dimensional forest space with the ease swamp cousins navigate water. Their cities hide so deep in unexplored jungles that other races might pass within yards without noticing.

Where other lizardfolk build prominent pyramids and visible settlements, jungle variants cultivate cities that blend seamlessly with the forest itself. Structures grow from living trees, paths follow branch networks, and the distinction between natural and constructed becomes meaningless. Only other jungle lizardfolk can reliably navigate these settlements; outsiders become hopelessly lost within minutes.

They're the most cautious and observant of lizardfolk variants, watching from concealment before revealing themselves. This isn't paranoia but practicality - dense jungles hide many dangers, and patient observation from camouflaged hiding spots has kept their civilization safe for millennia. When they do choose to interact, it's because they've already spent weeks or months studying potential partners from concealment.

## Region

Dense tropical forests, jungle canopies, and river basins where vegetation creates layered three-dimensional space. Jungle lizardfolk settlements exist primarily in the canopy, with structures hundreds of feet above ground connected by branch paths and vine bridges. They favor warm, humid forests with consistent rainfall and minimal seasonal variation.

## Magic Affinity

**Primary Schools:** Nature, Poison

Jungle Lizardfolk excel at magic that works with forest ecology - encouraging plant growth, communicating with jungle creatures, understanding the intricate poison systems that pervade their environment. Their nature magic emphasizes stealth and protection over raw power. Poison magic draws from their intimate knowledge of countless toxic plants and creatures, creating effects that work slowly but inevitably.

## Racial Skills

**Example Racial Skills:**

| Skill                                                | Tags                       | Effect                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| [Scaly Hide](../../../skills/passive/scaly-hide.md)  | Physical/Endurance, Nature | +3 AC natural armor, 5% damage reduction        |
| [Camouflage Scales](../../../skills/index.md)        | Nature, Stealth            | +30% stealth, scales adapt to surroundings      |
| [Climbing Mastery](../../../skills/index.md)         | Physical/Strength, Nature  | Climb at full movement speed, enhanced grip     |
| [Jungle Strider](../../../skills/index.md)           | Nature, Physical/Endurance | No movement penalty in jungle, navigate canopy  |
| [Poison Resistance](../../../skills/racial/index.md) | Physical/Endurance, Nature | High resistance to toxins and venoms            |
| [Venomous Bite](../../../skills/racial/index.md)     | Combat, Nature             | Bite attack with paralytic venom                |
| [Jungle Sense](../../../skills/index.md)             | Nature, Gathering          | Detect threats, find resources in dense forests |

**[Scaly Hide](../../../skills/passive/scaly-hide.md)**: Jungle variant scales are particularly flexible and adaptive, providing +3 AC natural armor and 5% physical damage reduction. Their scales also help them grip bark and branches during climbing.

**[Camouflage Scales](../../../skills/index.md)**: Jungle lizardfolk scales unconsciously adapt to match their surroundings, providing exceptional stealth bonuses (+30%) in natural environments. This isn't magical invisibility but highly effective natural camouflage. When remaining still, they become nearly impossible to spot visually.

**[Climbing Mastery](../../../skills/index.md)**: Enhanced grip strength and specialized claws allow jungle lizardfolk to climb at full movement speed without requiring checks for normal surfaces. They navigate vertical and inverted surfaces with ease, moving through canopy networks as naturally as walking on ground.

**[Jungle Strider](../../../skills/index.md)**: Jungle lizardfolk move through dense vegetation, vines, and forest undergrowth without movement penalties. They read the jungle instinctively, identifying safe paths through dangerous terrain and navigating by subtle forest signs. Canopy travel is second nature to them.

**[Poison Resistance](../../../skills/racial/index.md)**: Living in toxin-rich jungle environments has given jungle lizardfolk exceptional resistance to poisons and venoms. They can handle dangerous plants and creatures that would kill other races, and consume foods toxic to others without ill effect.

**[Venomous Bite](../../../skills/racial/index.md)**: Some jungle lizardfolk develop venomous glands, making their natural bite attack deliver paralytic toxins. This isn't immediately lethal but incapacitates prey (or enemies) through gradual paralysis. The patient hunter's weapon - slow, inevitable, and perfectly suited to jungle warfare.

**[Jungle Sense](../../../skills/index.md)**: Generations of forest life have taught jungle lizardfolk to read their environment with uncanny precision. They detect threats through subtle sound changes, identify medicinal and toxic plants by scent, and locate hidden water sources and rare resources that other races would miss entirely.

## Cultural Distinctions

Jungle Lizardfolk maintain lizardfolk patience but express it through observation rather than meditation. They might watch strangers for weeks from camouflaged positions before deciding whether to make contact. This isn't hostility - it's due diligence. Why rush into interaction when patient observation reveals so much?

Their settlements exist primarily in the canopy, with structures built hundreds of feet above ground. These aren't just homes but three-dimensional cities connected by branch paths, vine bridges, and rope networks. Ground level is rarely visited; the real jungle exists in the canopy where light, food, and safety coexist. Temples and important buildings grow from the largest trees, shaped over centuries into organic architecture.

Navigation in jungle lizardfolk cities requires understanding three-dimensional space in ways ground-dwelling races struggle with. What looks like impenetrable forest from below reveals itself as organized community from within the canopy. Only jungle lizardfolk (and occasionally [wood elves](../elves/wood.md)) can reliably find their way through these settlements.

Jungle lizardfolk culture emphasizes herbalism and toxicology. Every child learns to identify hundreds of plants - which heal, which kill, which paralyze, which provide nutrition. This knowledge isn't academic but survival-critical; the jungle offers both medicine and death, and only careful study reveals which is which. Their pharmaceutical knowledge rivals any civilization's, though they rarely share it with outsiders.

Ancestor consultation continues but takes unique forms. Rather than stone pyramids, jungle lizardfolk entomb ancestors in massive hollow trees, where mummified remains rest among the roots and branches. Priests climb to these sacred trees to seek wisdom, conducting rituals in canopy temples while looking down on the forest that has sustained their civilization for millennia.

## Relations

**With Other Variants:** Jungle Lizardfolk view swamp cousins as too exposed - why build visible pyramids when you can hide your entire city? Coastal variants seem dangerously social, interacting with far too many outsiders. Desert variants are barely understood; how does one survive without abundant water and vegetation?

**With Other Races:** Jungle Lizardfolk interact minimally with other races, preferring observation from concealment. [Wood Elves](../elves/wood.md) are occasionally encountered and cautiously respected as fellow forest dwellers. [Humans](../humans.md) are studied from hiding but rarely contacted directly. Most other races are simply unaware jungle lizardfolk cities exist nearby. Trade happens on jungle lizardfolk terms - when they choose to reveal themselves, conduct business efficiently, and disappear back into the canopy before partners can follow.

## Recommended Classes

Jungle Lizardfolk excel at stealth-focused and nature-aligned classes leveraging their forest mastery:

- **[Ranger](../../../classes/combat/index.md)**: Perfect fit for their stealth and jungle navigation abilities
- **[Scout](../../../classes/index.md)**: Natural role given their observation and camouflage expertise
- **[Herbalist](../../../classes/crafting/index.md)**: Leverages their extensive plant and toxin knowledge
- **[Alchemist](../../../classes/crafting/index.md)**: Expert at poison crafting and medicinal compounds
- **[Druid](../../../classes/magic/index.md)**: Deep connection to jungle ecology and nature magic
- **[Assassin](../../../classes/combat/index.md)**: Combines stealth, climbing, and poison expertise

Less suitable for social roles, heavy armor combat, or open terrain activities, though jungle lizardfolk [Rogues](../../../classes/combat/index.md) who leverage camouflage and three-dimensional mobility can be exceptionally effective in forest environments.
