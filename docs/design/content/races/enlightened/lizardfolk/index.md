# Lizardfolk

> **See [Base Traits](base/index.md)** for shared racial characteristics, lore, and cultural notes.

## Variants

Lizardfolk have adapted to various environments across the world, each variant developing distinct physiological traits and environmental specializations while maintaining their core identity as patient, methodical builders of ancient civilizations.

### Swamp Lizardfolk

The classical lizardfolk civilization - temple builders, careful astronomers, and patient craftspeople. They represent lizardfolk culture at its most traditional, maintaining the ancient ways in wetland city-states. Most interactions other races have with lizardfolk involve this variant.

**Key Features:** Water/Nature magic, temple complexes, baseline adaptation

### Coastal Lizardfolk

Maritime-adapted lizardfolk who took to the open ocean, becoming accomplished sailors and traders. Centuries of oceanic life and maritime trade have made them slightly more outgoing than their swamp cousins, though still distinctly lizardfolk in temperament.

**Key Features:** Enhanced swimming, maritime trade, Water/Weather magic

### Desert Lizardfolk

Arid-dwelling lizardfolk who thrive in heat that kills other races. They've mastered extreme temperature tolerance and can enter estivation - dormant states that conserve energy during the harshest conditions. Their cities showcase ingenious water management.

**Key Features:** Extreme heat adaptation, estivation ability, Sun/Fire magic

### Jungle Lizardfolk

Forest-adapted lizardfolk who developed camouflage scales and climbing ability. They move through dense canopy with the same ease swamp kin navigate water. The most elusive variant, their cities hide deep in unexplored jungles.

**Key Features:** Camouflage scales, climbing ability, Nature/Poison magic
