# Coastal Lizardfolk

> **Parent Race:** [Lizardfolk](base.md)

## Variant Overview

Coastal Lizardfolk adapted to life on and beneath the waves, becoming the most outgoing and trade-focused of all lizardfolk variants. Centuries of maritime commerce and interaction with diverse coastal settlements have taught them to navigate not just ocean currents but also the swift-moving currents of warm-blooded society - at least well enough to conduct business effectively.

They're still unmistakably lizardfolk - patient, methodical, emotionally subtle - but with a practical understanding that successful trade requires adapting communication styles to match your audience. A coastal lizardfolk merchant might not naturally understand why [humans](../humans.md) need decisions _today_, but they've learned to work within those constraints rather than being baffled by them.

Their settlements dot coastlines and islands, built where ocean and shore meet. Unlike the inland temple complexes of swamp cousins, coastal lizardfolk cities emphasize harbors, shipyards, and trade facilities. They maintain the astronomical traditions and ancestor worship but with a maritime flavor - star charts guide navigation, ancestors offer wisdom about trade routes and weather patterns.

## Region

Coastlines, islands, and shallow oceanic shelves where land and sea interact. Coastal lizardfolk cities feature extensive harbor facilities, ships designed for lizardfolk crew (more open to sun, with basking platforms), and architecture that accommodates both surface and underwater access. They favor warm coastal waters where sun exposure remains consistent.

## Magic Affinity

**Primary Schools:** Water, Weather

Coastal Lizardfolk excel at magic that masters maritime conditions - controlling currents, predicting storms, ensuring safe passage through dangerous waters. Their water magic emphasizes movement and navigation over the stillness of swamp variants. Weather magic helps them read atmospheric conditions and protect ships from storms that would devastate conventional vessels.

## Racial Skills

**Example Racial Skills:**

| Skill                                               | Tags                       | Effect                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| [Scaly Hide](../../../skills/passive/scaly-hide.md) | Physical/Endurance, Nature | +3 AC natural armor, 5% damage reduction              |
| [Amphibious](../../../skills/racial/index.md)       | Nature, Physical           | Breathe underwater, +50% swim speed                   |
| [Deep Sea Swimming](../../../skills/index.md)       | Nature, Physical/Endurance | +100% swim speed, pressure resistance, diving mastery |
| [Hold Breath](../../../skills/racial/index.md)      | Nature, Physical/Endurance | Hold breath 10x longer, extended underwater time      |
| [Salt Tolerance](../../../skills/racial/index.md)   | Physical/Endurance, Nature | No penalties in saltwater, resists dehydration        |
| [Weather Sense](../../../skills/common/index.md)    | Nature, Trade              | Predict weather patterns, identify storm signs        |

**[Scaly Hide](../../../skills/passive/scaly-hide.md)**: Like all lizardfolk, coastal variants possess protective scales providing +3 AC natural armor and 5% physical damage reduction. Saltwater exposure keeps their scales particularly healthy and resilient.

**[Amphibious](../../../skills/racial/index.md)**: Coastal lizardfolk breathe water as easily as air. Unlike swamp cousins adapted to still waters, they handle ocean currents, waves, and deeper diving with equal ease.

**[Deep Sea Swimming](../../../skills/index.md)**: Enhanced aquatic adaptation grants coastal lizardfolk exceptional swimming speed (+100% compared to baseline) and resistance to water pressure. They can dive to significant depths and maintain speed even in strong currents. This makes them natural sailors and underwater explorers.

**[Hold Breath](../../../skills/racial/index.md)**: Extended breath-holding capacity (measured in hours) allows coastal lizardfolk to perform underwater maintenance on ships, explore coastal caves, or conduct salvage operations without needing to surface frequently.

**[Salt Tolerance](../../../skills/racial/index.md)**: Adapted specifically to saltwater environments, coastal lizardfolk suffer no penalties from ocean water and resist dehydration better than other variants. They can drink brackish water if needed and handle long voyages without the constant fresh water needs of warm-blooded sailors.

**[Weather Sense](../../../skills/common/index.md)**: Generations of maritime experience have taught coastal lizardfolk to read atmospheric signs with uncanny accuracy. They predict weather changes, identify approaching storms, and understand seasonal patterns - knowledge crucial for safe navigation and profitable [trade](../../../systems/economy/index.md).

## Special Traits

| Social Standing   | Most outgoing variant, bridge between lizardfolk and other races     |

## Cultural Distinctions

Coastal Lizardfolk maintain lizardfolk patience and methodical thinking but apply it to maritime contexts. They plan trading voyages years in advance, calculating optimal routes based on seasonal patterns observed over decades. They build ships designed to last centuries, using construction techniques that account for salt, storms, and time.

Their settlements function as trading hubs connecting distant coastal communities. A coastal lizardfolk port might see [human](../humans.md) merchants, [dwarven](../dwarves/base.md) metalsmiths, [elven](../elves/base.md) craftspeople, and various tribal traders all conducting business. Coastal lizardfolk serve as intermediaries, patient enough to wait for deals to mature but practical enough to complete transactions before impatient partners leave.

Ships crewed by coastal lizardfolk have distinctive features - open deck areas for basking in sun, underwater access hatches, navigation charts that blend astronomical observation with weather prediction. These vessels move slower than human ships (lizardfolk aren't hasty) but weather storms that would sink conventional craft and arrive reliably over routes measured in seasons rather than weeks.

Coastal lizardfolk maintain ancestor consultation but with maritime focus. Mummified elders rest in coastal temples, offering guidance about navigation, trade negotiations, and weather interpretation. Their wisdom spans centuries of maritime experience, making them invaluable for planning long voyages or establishing new trade routes.

## Relations

**With Other Variants:** Coastal Lizardfolk respect swamp cousins as cultural keepers but find their isolation limiting. Desert variants seem admirable but incomprehensible - why endure such harsh dryness? Jungle variants are barely known; dense forests hold little interest for ocean-focused coastal lizardfolk.

**With Other Races:** Coastal Lizardfolk interact regularly with [humans](../humans.md), making them the most culturally adaptable variant. They've learned to read warm-blooded emotional displays, translate lizardfolk patience into terms hurried merchants understand, and conduct business across cultural divides. [Elves](../elves/base.md) make easier partners, sharing long-term perspectives. [Dwarven](../dwarves/base.md) metalwork enhances ship construction, creating mutually beneficial trading relationships.

## Recommended Classes

Coastal Lizardfolk excel at maritime-focused classes that leverage their aquatic mastery and trading expertise:

- **[Sailor](../../../classes/index.md)**: Natural fit for their maritime environment and enhanced swimming
- **[Water Mage](../../../classes/magic/index.md)**: Leverages oceanic magic affinity and weather control
- **[Merchant](../../../classes/trade/index.md)**: Benefits from their trading experience and patient negotiation
- **[Navigator](../../../classes/index.md)**: Perfect for their weather sense and astronomical knowledge
- **[Fisherman](../../../classes/gathering/index.md)**: Exceptional at oceanic resource gathering
- **[Ship Builder](../../../classes/crafting/index.md)**: Traditional expertise in maritime construction

Less suitable for landlocked roles or fast-paced social situations, though coastal lizardfolk [Traders](../../../classes/trade/index.md) who've learned to adapt to warm-blooded pace can be surprisingly effective merchants.
