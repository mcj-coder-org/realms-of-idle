# Swamp Lizardfolk

> **Parent Race:** [Lizardfolk](base.md)

## Variant Overview

Swamp Lizardfolk represent the classical lizardfolk civilization - the builders of stone pyramids, observers of stars, and keepers of ancient knowledge. They embody everything other races think of when they imagine lizardfolk: patient, methodical, traditional, living in harmony with wetland environments where water and land interweave.

Their cities rise from still waters - stone pyramids with precise astronomical alignments, canal systems connecting distant settlements, temple complexes designed to flood and drain with seasonal precision. These aren't just buildings; they're living records of millennia of careful observation, each stone placed according to calculations verified across generations.

Other races encounter swamp lizardfolk most frequently through trade. Exotic swamp resources, ancient knowledge, exceptional stonework - these flow outward from wetland city-states in carefully negotiated exchanges. Swamp lizardfolk maintain the old ways, consulting ancestors, following star patterns, and thinking in timeframes that exhaust shorter-lived races.

## Region

Swamps, marshes, river deltas, and wetlands where water and land create complex, shifting ecosystems. Swamp lizardfolk cities integrate seamlessly with these environments, using water's natural rhythms rather than fighting against them. They favor warm, humid regions where the sun can warm scales effectively and where seasonal flooding follows predictable patterns.

## Magic Affinity

**Primary Schools:** Water, Nature

Swamp Lizardfolk excel at magic that works with wetland environments - controlling water flow, encouraging plant growth, understanding the intricate balance of swamp ecosystems. Their water magic feels patient and inevitable, like rising tides or seasonal floods. Their nature magic emphasizes balance and sustainability rather than raw power.

## Racial Skills

**Example Racial Skills:**

| Skill                                               | Tags                         | Effect                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| [Scaly Hide](../../../skills/passive/scaly-hide.md) | Physical/Endurance, Nature   | +3 AC natural armor, 5% damage reduction         |
| [Thick Skin](../../../skills/passive/thick-skin.md) | Physical/Endurance, Physical | +2 AC natural armor, stacks with worn armor      |
| [Hold Breath](../../../skills/racial/index.md)      | Nature, Physical/Endurance   | Hold breath 10x longer, extended underwater time |
| [Amphibious](../../../skills/racial/index.md)       | Nature, Physical             | Breathe underwater, +50% swim speed              |
| [Bite Attack](../../../skills/index.md)             | Combat, Physical/Strength    | Natural weapon dealing 1d6 piercing damage       |
| [Swamp Strider](../../../skills/common/index.md)    | Nature, Gathering/Fishing    | No movement penalty in swamps, find resources    |

**[Scaly Hide](../../../skills/passive/scaly-hide.md)**: Reptilian scales provide real protection. Swamp lizardfolk have +3 AC natural armor and 5% physical damage reduction. This is lightweight, flexible, and stacks with worn [armor](../../../systems/combat/weapons-and-armor.md), making armored swamp lizardfolk exceptionally tough.

**[Thick Skin](../../../skills/passive/thick-skin.md)**: Some swamp lizardfolk develop especially tough hides, providing +2 additional AC. Combined with Scaly Hide, heavily-scaled specimens can have +5 AC before wearing any equipment.

**[Hold Breath](../../../skills/racial/index.md)**: Evolved for life in and around water, swamp lizardfolk can hold breath for extended periods - measured in hours, not minutes. This makes them exceptional divers and allows patient underwater ambushes or extended fishing expeditions.

**[Amphibious](../../../skills/racial/index.md)**: Swamp lizardfolk breathe water as easily as air, moving through their wetland homes without surface/submerged distinction. [Underwater combat](../../../systems/combat/index.md) poses no disadvantage to them. Swimming is as natural as walking.

**[Bite Attack](../../../skills/index.md)**: Powerful jaws provide a natural weapon dealing 1d6 piercing damage. Useful when disarmed or grappling, and can be used as an off-hand attack in [combat](../../../systems/combat/index.md).

**[Swamp Strider](../../../skills/common/index.md)**: Swamp lizardfolk move through swamps, marshes, and wetlands without movement penalties. They navigate murky waters instinctively, find hidden fishing spots, and locate swamp resources (reeds, medicinal plants, fish) efficiently.

## Cultural Distinctions

Swamp Lizardfolk maintain the most traditional and conservative culture among lizardfolk variants. They're the keepers of ancient knowledge, the builders who still follow construction techniques perfected millennia ago, the priests who consult ancestors and read star patterns before making major decisions.

Their daily life follows rhythms unchanged for centuries. Morning sun warms scales; work begins on projects measured in decades. Midday heat brings rest, meditation, and scholarly pursuits. Evening coolness resumes physical labor. Night belongs to astronomical observation and contemplation. A swamp lizardfolk can describe their schedule years in advance - and will follow it exactly.

Temple complexes dominate swamp lizardfolk cities. These aren't just places of worship but centers of learning, astronomical observation, and communal decision-making. The pyramids that rise from still waters serve as tombs, observatories, and repositories of accumulated wisdom. Mummified ancestors rest within, consulted through careful ritual when important questions arise.

Swamp lizardfolk craftsmanship emphasizes permanence. They build to last millennia, using techniques that produce structures virtually immune to time's erosion. Their stonework rivals [dwarven](../dwarves/base.md) quality, though achieved through patience rather than technological innovation. Why develop new methods when the old ones have worked for thousands of years?

## Relations

**With Other Variants:** Swamp Lizardfolk view themselves as the cultural heart of lizardfolk civilization. Coastal variants are respected but seen as somewhat too influenced by warm-blooded trading partners. Desert variants are admired for their extreme patience but their environment seems inhospitable. Jungle variants puzzle swamp lizardfolk - why choose dense forest over open wetland?

**With Other Races:** Swamp Lizardfolk interact with other races primarily through carefully controlled trade. [Humans](../humans.md) are useful trading partners but exhaustingly hurried. [Elves](../elves/base.md) at least understand long-term thinking, making them easier to work with. [Dwarves](../dwarves/base.md) appreciate quality stonework, creating mutual respect despite vast cultural differences. Tribal races are generally avoided unless they control needed resources.

## Recommended Classes

Swamp Lizardfolk excel at patient, methodical classes that leverage their traditional knowledge and wetland mastery:

- **[Water Mage](../../../classes/magic/index.md)**: Perfect fit for their aquatic environment and magic affinity
- **[Priest](../../../classes/magic/index.md)**: Natural role as keepers of ancestor wisdom and celestial knowledge
- **[Scholar](../../../classes/index.md)**: Leverages their accumulated knowledge and patient research
- **[Stoneworker](../../../classes/crafting/index.md)**: Traditional expertise in permanent construction
- **[Fisherman](../../../classes/gathering/index.md)**: Intimate knowledge of wetland resources
- **[Conjurer](../../../classes/magic/index.md)**: Water-based summoning and creation magic

Less suitable for fast-paced combat roles or social classes due to their methodical nature and subtle emotional expression, though swamp lizardfolk [Warriors](../../../classes/combat/index.md) who leverage natural armor and patience can be formidable defenders.
