# Mountain Dwarf

> **Parent Race:** [Dwarves](base/index.md)

## Variant Overview

Mountain Dwarves represent traditional dwarven culture at its most concentrated. Great holds carved deep into tall mountains, ancient forges burning with centuries-old coals, warrior traditions passed down through countless generations, and deep suspicion of any change. They produce the finest weapons and armor in the known world, and their martial traditions make them formidable warriors even among dwarvenkind.

## Region

High mountain ranges, where towering peaks reach toward the sky and holds delve miles deep into solid rock. The mountain holds are the oldest and most prestigious of all dwarven settlements - places like Ironhold, Stoneforge, and Silverpeak that have stood for thousands of years. These holds control rich mineral deposits and maintain the most complete ancient records of dwarven history and technique.

## Craft Focus

Weapons and armor of unparalleled quality. A mountain dwarf blade holds an edge that seems supernatural. Their armor turns blows that would punch through lesser makes. Siege engines, fortifications, and military engineering also fall within their mastery. Every mountain dwarf learns basic smithing, with the most talented becoming legendary weaponsmiths whose works are treasured for generations.

## Cultural Distinctions

Mountain Dwarves are the most traditional and conservative of all dwarven variants. They view themselves as the keepers of true dwarven culture, maintaining customs and techniques exactly as their ancestors did. This preservation-focused mindset makes them both respected and occasionally frustrating to other dwarves.

Their holds follow strict hierarchies based on clan lineage and martial achievement. A mountain dwarf's place in society depends heavily on their ancestry and combat prowess. Young mountain dwarves train extensively in weapons from childhood, even if they'll never be professional warriors - it's simply part of being properly dwarven.

They're the least likely dwarves to venture to the surface, and when they do, they rarely stay long. The surface seems chaotic and unreliable to mountain dwarves, who prefer the eternal stability of stone and tradition.

## Relations

**With Other Dwarves:** Mountain Dwarves see themselves as the standard by which all dwarves should be measured. They respect Hill Dwarves but consider them "softened" by surface contact. Deep Dwarves puzzle them - too isolated and strange. Forge Dwarves earn grudging respect for their smithing prowess, though mountain dwarves question some of their innovative techniques.

**With Other Races:** Mountain Dwarves maintain the most formal and distant relationships with non-dwarves. They trade extensively - everyone wants mountain dwarf weapons - but keep surface folk at arm's length. They respect [humans](../humans/index.md) who honor contracts and show martial skill, tolerate [elves](../elves/index.md) while finding their magic-focus distasteful, and remain wary of [tribal races](../../monstrous/index.md) as potential threats to their holds.

## Recommended Classes

Mountain Dwarves excel at martial and crafting classes that leverage their enhanced strength and weapon mastery:

- **[Warrior](../../../classes/combat/index.md)**: Natural fit, combining racial toughness with enhanced strength
- **[Knight](../../../classes/combat/index.md)**: Defensive specialists who can hold any line
- **[Blacksmith](../../../classes/crafting/index.md)**: Master weaponsmiths and armorers
- **[Berserker](../../../classes/combat/index.md)**: Channel dwarven endurance into devastating rage
- **[Guardian](../../../classes/combat/index.md)**: Protectors who use traditional dwarven tactics

Less suitable for magic-heavy classes due to racial magic resistance, though some mountain dwarves become competent [Enchanters](../../../classes/crafting/index.md), approaching magic with the same methodical mindset they apply to smithing.
