# Hill Dwarf

> **Parent Race:** [Dwarves](base.md)

## Variant Overview

Hill Dwarves adapted to life on the surface - or at least, closer to it. They maintain underground homes in the foothills but integrate far more with surface communities than their mountain cousins. They're the dwarves you'll most often meet in human cities, slightly less gruff and significantly better at diplomacy. Their crafts focus on everyday necessities and luxuries rather than purely military applications.

## Region

Rolling foothills and low mountains, where holds connect more easily to surface trade routes and farming valleys. Hill dwarf settlements often feature both underground chambers and surface structures, creating unique hybrid architecture. They maintain extensive surface farms, orchards, and pastures while keeping their most important forges and homes safely underground.

## Craft Focus

Brewing and farming dominate hill dwarf specialization, alongside general craftsmanship suited to civilian life. Hill dwarf ale is legendary - rich, complex, and potent enough to floor most humans after a single mug. They also excel at agricultural tools, furniture, practical metalwork, and the kind of everyday crafts that surface communities desperately need.

## Cultural Distinctions

Hill Dwarves bridge two worlds, maintaining dwarven traditions while adapting to surface practicalities. They learn early how to navigate both dwarven bluntness and surface diplomatic niceties, code-switching between cultures with practiced ease. This makes them invaluable as traders, diplomats, and cultural intermediaries.

Their holds are more open and welcoming than traditional mountain holds. Surface visitors don't face the immediate suspicion mountain dwarves project. Hill dwarf children grow up playing with human and halfling neighbors, learning multiple languages, and understanding that "the dwarven way" isn't the only way.

This adaptation comes with social costs. Mountain Dwarves sometimes dismiss hill dwarves as "surface-soft" or "human-friends." Hill Dwarves counter that adapting isn't weakness - it's practical survival in a changing world. This tension rarely breaks into open conflict, but it colors interactions between the two groups.

## Relations

**With Other Dwarves:** Hill Dwarves maintain good relations with all dwarven variants, serving as diplomatic bridges between more isolated groups. Mountain Dwarves respect their craftsmanship while questioning their cultural compromises. Deep Dwarves find them too gregarious. Forge Dwarves appreciate their practical innovations.

**With Other Races:** Hill Dwarves form the warmest relationships of any dwarven variant with non-dwarves. They're regular fixtures in [human](../humans.md) towns, welcome at halfling festivals, and maintain productive trade relationships with most civilized races. They understand surface social customs, remember to smile occasionally, and generally come across as "the friendly dwarf" to non-dwarven communities.

**With Players:** Hill Dwarves make excellent party members due to their enhanced charisma and diplomatic skills. They can serve as the party face while still bringing dwarven toughness and crafting expertise to bear.

## Recommended Classes

Hill Dwarves' enhanced charisma opens class options that suit other dwarves poorly:

- **[Merchant](../../../classes/../systems/social/index.md)**: Natural traders with crafting expertise and diplomatic skills
- **[Brewer](../../../classes/crafting/index.md)**: Master of legendary dwarven ale and spirits
- **[Farmer](../../../classes/gathering/index.md)**: Combine dwarven endurance with agricultural expertise
- **[Warrior](../../../classes/combat/index.md)**: Still formidable fighters, just more approachable ones
- **[Blacksmith](../../../classes/crafting/index.md)**: Civilian-focused crafts rather than military applications
- **[Bard](../../../classes/../systems/social/index.md)**: The rare "diplomatic dwarf" who can actually charm people
- **[Guild Leader](../../../classes/../systems/social/index.md)**: Organize and lead craft guilds in mixed communities

Their enhanced charisma partially offsets the typical dwarven penalty to social interaction, making them viable in roles that require negotiation and relationship-building.
