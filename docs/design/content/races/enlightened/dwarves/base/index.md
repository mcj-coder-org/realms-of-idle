# Dwarves

## Lore

### Origin

Dwarves emerged from the bones of the world itself - or so their legends claim. Whether literally born from living stone or simply shaped by countless generations underground, dwarves possess an affinity for earth and metal that borders on supernatural. They feel the weight of stone above, sense the grain of metal in ore, and know instinctively which tunnel will hold and which will collapse.

The great dwarven holds - part fortress, part city, part mine - delve deep into mountains across the realm. Some date back thousands of years, expanding generation by generation into vast underground metropolises. Dwarves don't abandon their holds lightly; a damaged section is repaired, not relocated. The deepest levels of Ironhold, the oldest dwarven settlement, plunge miles underground, where the heat grows oppressive and strange things dwell in the dark.

Magic and dwarves have an awkward relationship. Dwarven bodies resist magical energy, making them naturally resistant to spells - a survival advantage - but also limiting their own spellcasting potential. Most dwarves consider this a fair trade. "Give me good steel over fancy magic any day," goes the dwarven saying, and they mean it. Dwarven culture prizes the tangible, the measurable, the _real_ - and magic feels slippery and untrustworthy by comparison.

This practical focus made dwarves master crafters. A dwarven-forged blade holds an edge like nothing else. Dwarven armor turns blows that would punch through lesser makes. Dwarven architecture endures earthquakes that level human cities. It's not magic (though dwarves _can_ enchant when necessary) - it's simply perfection through patience, skill, and traditional techniques refined over millennia.

### In the World

Dwarven holds function as independent city-states, each governed by a council of clan elders or a hereditary king. They trade extensively with surface [settlements](../../../systems/world/settlements.md) - dwarven metalwork commands premium prices - but maintain fierce independence. A hold might ally with [human](../humans.md) kingdoms against mutual threats, but no dwarf bows to a surface-dwelling monarch.

Daily life in a hold follows patterns laid down generations ago. The morning shift descends to the [mines](../../../systems/crafting/gathering.md) while the evening shift ascends. Forges burn around the clock, their rhythm marking time better than any bell. Family workshops pass from parent to child, with apprentices spending decades mastering techniques their great-grandparents used. Change happens slowly, deliberately, and only when absolutely necessary.

Dwarves value reliability above all else. A dwarf's word is their bond - breaking an oath brings profound shame. Contracts get negotiated down to minute details, then honored absolutely. This makes dwarves trustworthy business partners but maddeningly inflexible. "The agreement says..." begins many a dwarven refusal to accommodate reasonable adjustments.

Other races respect dwarves while finding them exhausting. [Humans](../humans.md) admire dwarven [craftsmanship](../../../systems/crafting/index.md) but bridle at dwarven stubbornness. [Elves](../elves.md) respect dwarven longevity while considering them artistically primitive. [Tribal races](../../monstrous/index.md) see dwarves as both trading opportunity - all those metal goods - and territorial threat, as expanding holds sometimes clash with tribal ranges. Yet almost everyone wants dwarven-made equipment when they can afford it.

Surface dwarves are less common than humans or elves but not rare. Young dwarves might spend decades traveling the surface, learning other cultures, plying their crafts in foreign cities, or simply experiencing sunlight before returning home to settle into traditional roles. Some never return, founding surface smithies and becoming integral parts of human communities while maintaining distinct dwarven identity.

The greatest dwarven struggle isn't external but internal: balancing tradition with necessary change. The techniques that served for two thousand years might not suit modern threats. The alliances that worked for generations might need reassessment. But suggesting change to a dwarf is like suggesting the mountain move - possible, theoretically, but requiring tremendous force and leaving everyone grumpy about it.

See [Racial Synergies](../../../systems/character/racial-synergies.md) for detailed mechanics.

### Racial Skills

**Skill Pool Tags:** `Physical/Endurance`, `Physical/Strength`, `Crafting`, `Gathering/Mining`, `Combat/Defense`

Dwarves receive **3 random skills** from their racial skill pool at character creation, with additional skills available at racial milestone levels (10, 25, 50). Skills must match at least one of the pool tags above.

**Example Racial Skills:**

| Skill                                                            | Tags                                  | Effect                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| [Stout Constitution](../../skills/passive/stout-constitution.md) | Physical/Endurance                    | +15% HP, +20% poison/disease resistance       |
| [Darkvision](../../skills/passive/darkvision.md)                 | Physical, Universal/Physical          | Perfect vision in complete darkness           |
| [Stone Sense](../../skills/passive/stone-sense.md)               | Gathering/Mining, Physical, Knowledge | Detect ore, structural weaknesses, navigation |
| [Magic Resistance](../../skills/passive/magic-resistance.md)     | Universal/Mental, Magic               | +20% resistance to hostile magic              |
| [Steady Stance](../../skills/passive/steady-stance.md)           | Physical/Endurance, Combat/Defense    | +70% knockback resistance, stability          |
| [Dense Build](../../skills/passive/dense-build.md)               | Physical/Strength                     | 1.5x weight, +10% strength checks             |

**[Stout Constitution](../../skills/passive/stout-constitution.md)**: Dwarves are built like boulders - dense, solid, and hard to damage. Their naturally robust constitution makes them excellent [warriors](../../../classes/combat/index.md) and allows them to shrug off poisons and diseases that would fell [humans](../humans.md).

**[Darkvision](../../skills/passive/darkvision.md)**: Generations underground bred perfect dark-sight into dwarven eyes. They see in absolute darkness as clearly as [humans](../humans.md) see at noon. Bright light doesn't blind them, but they're equally comfortable in cave blackness or surface daylight.

**[Stone Sense](../../skills/passive/stone-sense.md)**: Dwarves don't just see stone - they _understand_ it. A dwarf can run their hand along a tunnel wall and know how stable it is, where veins of [ore](../../../systems/crafting/gathering.md) hide, whether the ceiling is safe. This isn't [magic](../../../systems/character/magic-system.md); it's deep intuition from living their entire lives in stone.

**[Magic Resistance](../../skills/passive/magic-resistance.md)**: The same property that limits dwarven spellcasting also protects them. Hostile [magic](../../../systems/character/magic-system.md) finds less purchase on dwarven targets. This resistance is significant - dwarven [warriors](../../../classes/combat/index.md) advance through magical barrages that would stop [human](../humans.md) charges cold.

**[Steady Stance](../../skills/passive/steady-stance.md)**: Dwarves are hard to move. [Knockback](../../../systems/combat/index.md) effects that send [humans](../humans.md) flying barely budge dwarves. Trips and knockdowns that reliably fell other races meet dwarven balance and mass. In [combat](../../../systems/combat/index.md), this makes dwarves excellent front-line fighters who hold position.

**[Dense Build](../../skills/passive/dense-build.md)**: Dwarven bodies are extraordinarily dense - solid muscle and heavy bone. This extra mass provides strength advantages and exceptional stability, though it affects mobility in certain situations like swimming or climbing.

**Note on Magic:** Dwarves' magic resistance comes at a cost - they have reduced mana pools (-35%) and slower mana regeneration (-25%). Most dwarves embrace this trade-off, preferring steel and stone over spell and sorcery.

## Cultural Notes

### The Clan System

Dwarven identity centers on clan membership. Your clan determines your initial trade, your social standing, your likely marriage prospects, and your place in hold politics. Clans aren't just families - they're ancient institutions with generations of reputation and obligation attached.

Losing clan membership - through exile or dishonor - is the worst fate a dwarf can imagine. Clanless dwarves exist in a social limbo, technically still dwarven but without the support structures that define dwarven life. They often end up on the surface permanently, unable to return home.

### The Grudge Book

Dwarven holds maintain official records of grudges - wrongs that must be avenged or recompensed. Some grudges date back centuries. The fact that the original participants are long dead doesn't matter; the grudge persists until formally settled. This tradition creates both stability (contracts are honored) and absurdity (feuds over ancient insults).

Young dwarves sometimes question the grudge system. Elders respond that traditions endure because they work, and besides, your great-grandfather's honor demands satisfaction. The tension between practicality and tradition defines much of modern dwarven culture.

### Dwarven Humor

Dwarves possess a dry, sarcastic sense of humor that translates poorly across cultural boundaries. What a dwarf considers friendly ribbing - "Your beard looks like a rat's nest" - strikes humans as insulting. What humans consider friendly banter - "Just joking around!" - strikes dwarves as unserious frivolity. This leads to frequent social misfires.

Dwarves who've spent time on the surface learn to code-switch between dwarven directness and surface diplomacy. Those who haven't often give offense without meaning to, reinforcing the "gruff dwarf" stereotype that irritates dwarves who know they're just being honest.

### Gender and Beards

The old joke - "How do you tell male and female dwarves apart? You ask." - has truth to it. Female dwarves grow beards as luxurious as males', wear similar practical clothing, work the same trades, and culturally value the same traits. Surface races obsessed with visible gender markers find this confusing. Dwarves find _that_ confusing.

Within dwarven culture, gender matters for certain things (childbirth being rather hard to reassign) but not for social role, occupation, or worth. A female warrior or male weaver raises no eyebrows. Dwarven names aren't gendered. Surface dwellers who try to "figure out" a dwarf's gender usually end up embarrassing themselves.

### The Surface Question

Every generation, some young dwarves get wanderlust, drawn to surface life with its variety and change. Elders grumble but understand - it's a phase. Most return home within decades, surface curiosity satisfied. But some stay, founding surface smithies, marrying surface folk, raising children who barely know the holds.

This creates tension. Are surface dwarves still truly dwarven? They maintain the crafting traditions, the stubborn nature, the practical focus - but they lack deep connection to clan and hold. Different dwarves answer differently, creating an ongoing cultural debate without clear resolution.

### Engineering Over Magic

Dwarves trust what they can measure, test, and replicate. A magical ward might fail unpredictably; a properly engineered door will hold until the stone itself crumbles. This philosophy produces incredible mechanical engineering - gear systems, hydraulics, precision metalwork - all designed to eliminate magic's role.

Ironically, this makes dwarven enchanted items highly sought. When a dwarf _does_ enchant something, they approach it with the same meticulous engineering mindset. The result: stable, reliable, long-lasting enchantments that work exactly as specified. They're less flashy than elven magical works but far more dependable.
