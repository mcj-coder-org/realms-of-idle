# Deep Dwarf

> **Parent Race:** [Dwarves](base.md)

## Variant Overview

Deep Dwarves delved deepest and stayed there. Their holds plunge miles below the surface, into regions where the heat grows oppressive and strange creatures dwell in eternal darkness. They rarely emerge, maintaining mysterious settlements in the depths where conventional mining gives way to excavating exotic minerals and gems found nowhere else. Other dwarves consider them eccentric at best, obsessive at worst. Deep Dwarves consider other dwarves soft surface-dwellers who lack proper appreciation for the earth's true depths.

## Region

The deepest underground regions, far below normal mining depth. Where other dwarves stop digging, Deep Dwarves begin. Their holds exist in cavern systems natural and carved, connected by vertical shafts that plunge through layers of stone. The environment is harsh - heat, pressure, strange fungi, and creatures adapted to eternal darkness. Deep dwarf holds are small, isolated, and largely self-sufficient by necessity.

## Craft Focus

Gems and rare metals that exist only at extreme depth. Deep Dwarves work with materials other smiths never see - exotic crystals with unusual properties, metals that only form under tremendous pressure, strange alloys possible only in the deep heat. Their jewelry commands astronomical prices for both beauty and unique magical properties. They also develop specialized equipment for deep excavation and survival in extreme underground conditions.

## Cultural Distinctions

Deep Dwarves developed a culture shaped by isolation and extreme environment. They're quieter than other dwarves, adapted to settlements where sounds echo for miles through stone. They communicate as much through subtle gestures and stone-tapping signals as through speech. Their sense of time differs - in perpetual darkness, "day" and "night" lose meaning, replaced by work-cycles and geological processes.

They're suspicious of outsiders to a degree that makes mountain dwarves look welcoming. A deep dwarf hold might go generations without surface contact. When they do trade, it's through carefully controlled exchanges at designated neutral locations. They don't distrust other dwarves exactly, but they've adapted to depths that would drive surface dwarves mad, and they're protective of their hard-won isolation.

Deep Dwarf craftsmanship focuses on small, perfect works rather than large-scale projects. A deep dwarf might spend a decade cutting and setting a single perfect gemstone. They have patience that amazes even other dwarves, viewing decade-long projects as "quick work."

## Relations

**With Other Dwarves:** Deep Dwarves maintain minimal contact with other variants. Mountain Dwarves respect their craftsmanship but find them unsettlingly strange. Hill Dwarves barely understand them. Forge Dwarves share some commonalities - both work in extreme heat and with exotic materials - leading to occasional productive exchanges. But mostly, Deep Dwarves keep to themselves.

**With Other Races:** Most surface races never meet a deep dwarf. Those who do find them disconcerting - too quiet, too intense, too focused on depths and darkness. Deep Dwarves view surface races as ephemeral and shallow (literally). They're not hostile, just... disconnected. Their concerns - the stability of stone miles down, the growth patterns of pressure-crystal, the behavior of deep-earth fungi - don't overlap with surface interests.

**With Players:** Deep Dwarf player characters are unusual - something drove them to surface that wouldn't affect most of their kind. This creates interesting roleplay opportunities around isolation, cultural disconnection, and adjustment to a world with actual daylight.

## Recommended Classes

Deep Dwarves excel at specialized crafting and roles requiring patience and perception:

- **[Gemcutter](../../../classes/crafting/index.md)**: Master of precious stones and crystalline materials
- **[Jewelcrafter](../../../classes/crafting/index.md)**: Create unique pieces using deep-earth gems
- **[Miner](../../../classes/gathering/index.md)**: Expert in extreme-depth excavation techniques
- **[Scout](../../../classes/../systems/world/index.md)**: Enhanced darkvision makes them superb underground scouts
- **[Blacksmith](../../../classes/crafting/index.md)**: Specialists in exotic metals and rare alloys
- **[Geologist](../../../classes/magic/index.md)**: Deep understanding of stone and earth

Less suitable for social or surface-focused classes. Deep Dwarves lack charisma bonuses and cultural context for surface interaction. They're at their best when delving dungeons, exploring caves, or working with rare materials in quiet concentration.

## Special Note: Enhanced Darkvision

Deep Dwarves possess darkvision superior even to standard dwarven dark-sight. They perceive detail in complete darkness that other dwarves miss, see farther, and notice subtle variations in stone texture and heat signature. In pitch-black conditions, they're the ultimate underground scouts. However, they're also more sensitive to sudden bright light, requiring brief adjustment periods when emerging into full daylight.
