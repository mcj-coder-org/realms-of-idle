# Mountain Kobold

> **Parent Race:** [Kobolds](base.md)

## Variant Overview

Mountain Kobolds represent traditional kobold culture at its most concentrated. Great warrens carved deep into tall mountains, ancient forges burning with carefully hoarded coals, trap systems of legendary complexity, and unwavering dragon veneration. They dig the deepest, craft the most elaborately, and maintain the purest connection to kobold heritage. Other kobolds consider them the baseline - the standard by which all others are measured.

## Region

High mountain ranges, where towering peaks reach toward the sky and warrens delve miles deep into solid rock. The mountain warrens are the oldest and most prestigious of all kobold settlements - places like Snapjaw Warren, Brightscale Deep, and Dragon's Shadow that have expanded for generations. These warrens control rich mineral deposits and maintain the most complete trap design libraries and draconic lore collections.

## Craft Focus

Mining and metalwork of exceptional quality. A mountain kobold mine shaft follows ore veins with surgical precision. Their metal traps use exotic alloys that resist corrosion and maintain tension for decades. Ore refinement, precious metal extraction, and gem cutting also fall within their mastery. Every mountain kobold learns basic mining, with the most talented becoming legendary ore-finders whose intuition borders on magical.

## Cultural Distinctions

Mountain Kobolds are the most traditional and conservative of all kobold variants. They view themselves as the keepers of true kobold culture, maintaining tunnel designs and trap philosophies exactly as their ancestors perfected them. This preservation-focused mindset makes them both respected and occasionally frustrating to other kobolds.

Their warrens follow strict meritocratic hierarchies based on craft mastery and innovation. A mountain kobold's place in society depends entirely on their skill - but proving that skill requires access to training and materials that lineage often provides. Young mountain kobolds compete intensely in skill trials, knowing their entire future depends on demonstrating excellence.

They're the least likely kobolds to venture to the surface for extended periods, and when they do, they struggle most with the adjustment. The surface seems chaotic and vulnerable to mountain kobolds, who trust only in deep stone and multiple escape routes.

## Cold Adaptation

Mountain kobolds evolved in freezing high-altitude environments where warrens must withstand both external cold and internal temperature management challenges. Their +20% cold resistance allows them to work in frigid conditions that would incapacitate other kobolds, maintaining mines at altitudes where water freezes and surface creatures cannot survive.

This adaptation makes them valuable in any cold environment - frozen mountain passes, ice caves, winter expeditions. They don't enjoy the cold any more than other kobolds, but they function effectively where others fail.

## Ore Expertise

Mountain kobolds possess supernatural-seeming intuition for ore deposits. They can examine a rock face and know what metals lie within. They sense where veins run, how deep they go, and what quality to expect. This isn't just experience - it's a refined instinct passed down through generations of mining-focused culture.

This expertise makes mountain kobolds highly sought after as mining consultants and prospectors. A mountain kobold's assessment of a potential mine site is trusted more than any survey. Their services command premium prices, and they know it.

## Relations

**With Other Kobolds:** Mountain Kobolds see themselves as the standard by which all kobolds should be measured. They respect Forest Kobolds but consider them "diluted" by surface adaptation. Urban Kobolds puzzle them - too socially flexible and insufficiently paranoid. Dragonsworn earn profound respect and envy, having achieved proximity to dragons that mountain kobolds dream of.

**With Other Races:** Mountain Kobolds maintain formal and cautious relationships with non-kobolds. They trade their mining expertise and rare ores - everyone needs what mountain kobolds find - but keep surface folk at careful distance. They respect [dwarves](../dwarves/base.md) as fellow master crafters while resenting being compared to them, tolerate [humans](../humans.md) as useful trading partners, and remain deeply suspicious of anyone who approaches their warrens without invitation.

## Recommended Classes

Mountain Kobolds excel at crafting and technical classes that leverage their mining expertise and traditional knowledge:

- **[Trapsmith](../../../classes/crafting/index.md)**: Natural fit, combining traditional trap-making with metal expertise
- **[Miner](../../../classes/crafting/index.md)**: Master ore-finders and tunnel specialists
- **[Artificer](../../../classes/crafting/index.md)**: Mechanical innovators working in traditional frameworks
- **[Geomancer](../../../classes/magic/index.md)**: Earth magic specialists with innate stone sense
- **[Scout](../../../classes/../systems/world/index.md)**: Underground pathfinders and trap detectors

Well-suited for any role requiring underground expertise, trap design, or mining knowledge. Less suitable for heavily social roles due to their limited surface adaptation and traditional conservatism.
