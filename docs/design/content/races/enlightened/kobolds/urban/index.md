# Urban Kobold

> **Parent Race:** [Kobolds](base.md)

## Variant Overview

Urban Kobolds live in or beneath cities, often maintaining the sewer and utility systems that keep settlements functioning. Generations of surface contact made them more socially adept and significantly less light-sensitive than their warren-dwelling cousins. They're the kobolds other races most often encounter - the friendly (by kobold standards) tinker in the market, the indispensable sewer engineer, the clever mechanism repairer. Other kobolds consider them strange but undeniably successful at surface integration.

## Region

Beneath and within cities, particularly large [human](../humans.md) settlements with extensive underground infrastructure. Urban kobolds build their communities in sewer systems, utility tunnels, and abandoned cellars, creating comfortable spaces within the city's hidden depths. Unlike traditional warrens, urban kobold settlements must accommodate constant interaction with surface dwellers, shaping their entire culture.

## Craft Focus

Engineering and practical mechanism design. Urban kobolds specialize in systems that make cities function - water management, waste disposal, gas lines, mechanical doors, clock towers, and countless other infrastructure components. Their work tends toward reliable functionality rather than elaborate complexity. They also excel at repair work, understanding how to fix diverse mechanisms rather than perfecting a single type. Every urban kobold learns basic engineering, with the most talented becoming indispensable city infrastructure specialists whose services command steady income.

## Special Traits

| Trait              | Value                                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Attribute Modifier | +1 CHA (in addition to base racial attributes)             |
| Special Resistance | Reduced sunlight sensitivity (-5% penalty instead of -10%) |
| Special Focus      | Engineering, infrastructure, urban systems                 |
| Environment        | Cities, urban underground, surface buildings               |
| Cultural Emphasis  | Social integration, practical solutions, steady employment |
| Trade Specialty    | Infrastructure maintenance, mechanism repair, consultation |

## Cultural Distinctions

Urban Kobolds are the most socially adapted and diplomatically skilled of all kobold variants. Constant surface interaction taught them to read [human](../humans.md) expressions, moderate their directness, and navigate complex social situations. They're still kobolds - blunt, work-focused, size-sensitive - but they've learned to code-switch between kobold and surface communication styles.

Their communities organize around practical work rather than theoretical perfection. An urban kobold measures success by steady employment and satisfied clients more than technical mastery. This doesn't mean they're less skilled - urban kobold work must function reliably or cities grind to a halt - but they've embraced "good enough to work perfectly" over "perfect in every theoretical dimension."

Urban kobolds spend most of their time on the surface or in spaces with regular surface contact. This made them comfortable with concepts that bewilder traditional kobolds - rent, business licenses, customer service, even small talk. They're the most likely kobolds to have genuine friendships with non-kobolds.

## Social Adaptation

Urban kobolds receive +1 Charisma, reflecting generations of surface social interaction. This doesn't make them charming by [elf](../elves/base.md) standards, but they understand surface social rules and can navigate them competently. They know when to be diplomatic, how to negotiate without giving offense, and which social niceties actually matter to surface races.

This social skill makes urban kobolds excellent merchants, diplomats, and service providers. They're the kobolds who can explain technical issues to non-technical clients, negotiate fair contracts without creating grudges, and maintain positive long-term business relationships.

## Reduced Sunlight Sensitivity

Urban kobolds suffer only -5% penalty in bright daylight compared to -10% for standard kobolds. While they still prefer shade and indoor work, they function adequately in full sunlight - more like someone who needs sunglasses than someone physically pained by brightness. This adaptation developed over generations of surface work.

This reduced sensitivity makes urban kobolds the preferred choice for any role requiring regular daylight activity in cities - market work, above-ground repairs, business meetings, customer consultations. They won't seek out noon sunbathing, but they won't suffer the debilitating effects that would cripple a mountain kobold.

## Engineering Practicality

Urban kobolds approach engineering with ruthless practicality. Does it work? Can it be maintained? Will parts be available in five years? Is it repairable by competent non-specialists? These questions matter more than elegance or innovation. Urban kobold designs prioritize reliability, maintainability, and compatibility with existing systems.

This philosophy produces less impressive but more valuable work. A urban kobold's water pump isn't the most efficient possible, but it works reliably for decades with minimal maintenance using commonly available parts. For cities, this reliability is worth more than theoretical optimization.

## Relations

**With Other Kobolds:** Urban Kobolds occupy a complicated position in kobold society. Mountain Kobolds consider them corrupted by surface culture, having lost touch with true kobold values. Forest Kobolds see them as too focused on [human](../humans.md) approval. Dragonsworn pity them for being so far removed from dragon veneration. Yet urban kobolds often have the most stable income, best living conditions, and strongest political connections of any variant - success that's hard to dismiss.

**With Other Races:** Urban Kobolds maintain the closest and most positive relationships with surface races. [Humans](../humans.md) view them as valuable specialists and reliable workers. [Dwarves](../dwarves/base.md) respect their engineering skills while finding them insufficiently traditional. [Elves](../elves/base.md) appreciate their adaptability while questioning their aesthetic standards. City governments often employ urban kobolds officially for infrastructure maintenance, giving them legal status and protection unusual for kobolds.

## Recommended Classes

Urban Kobolds excel at social, technical, and service classes that leverage their adaptation and engineering focus:

- **[Artificer](../../../classes/crafting/index.md)**: Natural fit, combining mechanical expertise with practical design
- **[Engineer](../../../classes/crafting/index.md)**: Infrastructure specialists and system designers
- **[Merchant](../../../classes/../systems/social/index.md)**: Traders who understand both kobold crafts and surface markets
- **[Tinker](../../../classes/crafting/index.md)**: Repair specialists and mechanism experts
- **[Diplomat](../../../classes/../systems/social/index.md)**: Rare kobold social specialists who bridge cultures
- **[Rogue](../../../classes/../systems/combat/index.md)**: Urban environment experts with knowledge of city infrastructure

Well-suited for any role requiring city knowledge, social interaction, or practical engineering. Less suitable for wilderness operations or traditional warren culture roles.
