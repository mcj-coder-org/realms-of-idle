> **See [Base Traits](base/index.md)** for shared racial characteristics, lore, and cultural notes.

## Variants

Kobolds have adapted to various environments and specializations, creating distinct regional variants while maintaining their core identity as master trap-makers and dragon-venerating craftspeople.

### Mountain Kobold

Traditional warrens of the high peaks, representing classical kobold culture at its most concentrated. Masters of mining and metalwork, with the strongest dragon veneration and most elaborate underground cities. They view themselves as the keepers of true kobold heritage.

**Key Features:** +20% cold resistance, ore expertise, traditional warrens
