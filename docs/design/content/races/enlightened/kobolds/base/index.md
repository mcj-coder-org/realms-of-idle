# Kobolds

## Lore

### Origin

Kobolds claim descent from dragons - a claim that sounds absurd until you see them work. That same obsessive attention to detail, that drive for perfection, that instinct to create elaborate systems - it's all there, just scaled down to creatures standing three feet tall. Whether true draconic ancestry or simply cultural emulation over countless generations, kobolds embody draconic traits in compact, industrious form.

The great kobold warrens tunnel beneath mountains and hills, creating underground cities of staggering complexity. Passages twist and interconnect in three dimensions, with trap systems, ventilation networks, water management, and defensive positions all seamlessly integrated. A warren takes generations to complete and never truly finishes - there's always another improvement to make, another section to expand, another system to optimize.

Kobolds organize themselves meritocratically. The best trapsmith, not the strongest warrior, might lead. The most innovative tinker earns respect regardless of lineage. Warren councils include representatives from every specialized trade - mining, metalwork, stonecraft, trapmaking, alchemy, and more. This produces efficient governance but constant competition, as every kobold strives to prove their worth through excellence in their chosen craft.

Dragon veneration shapes kobold culture profoundly. They don't worship dragons as gods but admire them as the ultimate artisans and engineers. A dragon's hoard represents curated excellence - every item chosen for quality and beauty. A dragon's lair demonstrates masterful design - defensible, comfortable, dramatic. Kobolds aspire to these standards, knowing they'll never quite achieve them but finding satisfaction in the attempt.

### In the World

Kobold warrens function as independent city-states, each with its own council and specializations. They trade extensively - kobold-made traps, mechanisms, and devices command good prices - but maintain fierce independence. A warren pledges loyalty to no surface power, though they'll make pragmatic alliances when advantageous.

Daily life in a warren revolves around work. Kobolds wake, check their assignments, labor through their shifts, and rest before repeating the cycle. This sounds grim, but kobolds genuinely enjoy productive work. A well-designed trap mechanism brings them joy. A perfectly-dug tunnel satisfies deeply. They're not driven by external pressure but by internal standards that demand excellence.

Other races have complicated relationships with kobolds. [Dwarves](../dwarves/base/index.md) respect their engineering while considering them annoyingly small and talkative. [Humans](../humans/index.md) appreciate kobold-made goods while finding the warren environment claustrophobic. [Elves](../elves/base/index.md) acknowledge kobold magical aptitude while questioning their obsession with dragons. Most everyone agrees kobolds are useful neighbors - unless you accidentally stumble into their territorial range.

Kobolds struggle on the surface. Bright daylight hurts their dark-adapted eyes. The open sky feels oppressively vast. Surface structures seem impossibly vulnerable - where are the fallback positions, the trapped corridors, the escape tunnels? Yet some kobolds venture topside, driven by curiosity or assigned to trade missions. They work better at night or in covered markets, squinting through sunny days.

Surface [settlements](../../../systems/world/settlements/index.md) with nearby kobold warrens often develop mutually beneficial relationships. The warren provides exceptional mechanisms, traps for defense, and [mining](../../../systems/crafting/gathering/index.md) expertise. The settlement offers surface goods, agricultural products, and trade connections. Problems arise when surface expansion encroaches on warren territory or when kobolds' territorial instincts clash with [human](../humans/index.md) concepts of property.

The greatest challenge for kobolds is their own drive for perfection. A project always has room for improvement. That mechanism could be tighter. This trap could be cleverer. That tunnel alignment is slightly off. This endless refinement produces exceptional results but also causes kobolds to rarely feel truly satisfied. There's always more to do, always better to be.

### Racial Skills

**Skill Pool Tags:** `Crafting`, `Gathering/Mining`, `Stealth`, `Physical/Agility`, `Knowledge`

Kobolds receive **3 random skills** from their racial skill pool at character creation, with additional skills available at racial milestone levels (10, 25, 50). Skills must match at least one of the pool tags above.

**Example Racial Skills:**

| Skill                                                            | Tags                                   | Effect                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| [Darkvision](../../../skills/passive/darkvision/index.md)        | Physical, Universal/Physical           | Perfect vision in complete darkness        |
| [Pack Tactics](../../../skills/passive/pack-tactics/index.md)    | Combat/Tactics, Tribal, Nature/Animals | +15% accuracy with nearby allies           |
| [Nimble Escape](../../../skills/passive/nimble-escape/index.md)  | Physical/Agility, Stealth              | Disengage/Hide as bonus action             |
| [Trap Master](../../../skills/tiered/index.md)                   | Crafting, Knowledge                    | +25% trap quality, +20% trap detection     |
| [Tunnel Sense](../../../skills/racial/index.md)                  | Gathering/Mining, Knowledge            | Detect structural issues, hidden passages  |
| [Tinkerer's Intuition](../../../skills/mechanic-unlock/index.md) | Crafting, Knowledge                    | +10% crafting speed, understand mechanisms |

**[Darkvision](../../../skills/passive/darkvision/index.md)**: Generations underground bred perfect dark-sight into kobold eyes. They see in absolute blackness as clearly as [humans](../humans/index.md) see in daylight. This makes warrens navigable without torches - kobolds save lighting for important areas or when hosting surface visitors.

**[Pack Tactics](../../../skills/passive/pack-tactics/index.md)**: Kobolds evolved as cooperative hunters and defenders. When working together (ally within 5 feet), they gain +15% accuracy on attacks. They instinctively coordinate - flanking, distracting, striking from multiple angles. They're more dangerous in groups than individually.

**[Nimble Escape](../../../skills/passive/nimble-escape/index.md)**: Kobolds can Disengage or Hide as a bonus action instead of a full action. Combined with their small size, this makes them incredibly difficult to pin down in [combat](../../../systems/combat/index.md). They escape, reposition, and strike from unexpected angles.

**[Trap Master](../../../skills/tiered/index.md)**: Kobolds possess intuitive understanding of mechanisms and triggers. They craft better traps (+25% quality) faster than other races, and when encountering traps, they spot them more readily (+20% detection). This isn't just mechanical skill - it's an instinct for how systems work.

**[Tunnel Sense](../../../skills/racial/index.md)**: Like [dwarves](../dwarves/base/index.md) but more focused, kobolds sense structural issues in tunnels and underground spaces. They know when a ceiling is unsafe, where hidden passages might run, and how to read stone for weakness. This keeps warrens stable despite their complexity.

**[Tinkerer's Intuition](../../../skills/mechanic-unlock/index.md)**: Kobolds work faster at [crafting](../../../systems/crafting/index.md) tasks (+10% speed). Not from rushing, but from practiced efficiency. They understand how devices work intuitively, eliminating wasted motion and unnecessary steps.

**Limitations:**

- **Small Frame:** -10% health, +15% dodge chance. Standing three feet tall brings fragility but also stealth and dodge advantages.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** -10% to all actions in bright daylight. Dark-adapted eyes suffer in sunlight. Function fine in shade, indoors, or at night.

**Other Traits:**

- **Dragon Blood:** +15% fire resistance, bonus to draconic/fire [magic](../../../systems/character/magic-system/index.md). Dragons recognize something kindred in kobolds.

## Cultural Notes

### The Meritocracy Question

Kobold warrens claim to be pure meritocracies - the best rise to leadership regardless of birth. In practice, it's more complicated. Children of master crafters have better access to training and materials. Certain lineages produce generations of excellence. But a truly talented kobold _can_ rise from nowhere, and regularly does. This balance between hereditary advantage and genuine merit defines warren politics.

Young kobolds compete intensely to prove their worth. Apprenticeships are earned through skill trials. Journeyman positions require public demonstration. Mastery means peer recognition, not just years of service. This produces excellent crafters but also creates losers - kobolds who try and fail, finding themselves relegated to basic labor. The system works brilliantly for winners and harshly for everyone else.

### Dragon Dreams

Every kobold secretly (or not so secretly) dreams of meeting a real dragon. The actual experience usually disappoints - dragons view kobolds as interesting vermin at best - but the dream persists. Warrens celebrate stories of ancestors who served dragons, questionable tales that grow more heroic with each retelling.

Some kobolds make finding dragons their life's work, becoming traveling tinkers who follow rumors of draconic sightings. Most never succeed, spending their lives chasing legends. The few who do encounter dragons return changed - sometimes inspired, sometimes devastated, rarely indifferent.

### The Perfection Trap

Kobolds struggle with "good enough." That mechanism works fine but could be 5% more efficient. That tunnel is stable but could have slightly better angles. This room functions but could be more defensible. The drive for improvement never stops, and sometimes kobolds tear down perfectly functional work to rebuild it "properly."

Elder kobolds learn (sometimes) to balance perfection and completion. Younger kobolds often don't, endlessly iterating on projects that should be done. This is both kobold culture's greatest strength - producing truly exceptional work - and greatest weakness - preventing satisfaction and closure.

### Size and Dignity

Kobolds are sensitive about their size. Being called "cute" or "little" or being patted on the head enrages them. They're serious craftspeople and demand respect for their work, not condescension for their stature. Surface races that treat kobolds like children rapidly find themselves without kobold cooperation.

Conversely, kobolds respect anyone who judges them on output rather than size. A human who says "This mechanism is brilliant" earns kobold friendship. One who says "That's impressive for someone so small" earns kobold resentment. The line is fine but important.

### Trap Philosophy

To kobolds, a perfect trap is a work of art. It should be deadly yet elegant, complex yet reliable, hidden yet (in retrospect) obvious. A crude pit trap is an insult to the craft. A mechanically intricate, perfectly concealed, wickedly clever trap is a masterpiece.

Kobolds debate trap philosophy endlessly. Should traps kill or capture? Warn intruders or silently eliminate? Be reusable or single-use but devastating? These aren't just practical questions - they're aesthetic and ethical ones. Kobold trap philosophy texts fill warren libraries.

### Names and Identity

Kobolds earn their names through accomplishment. A young kobold might be called "Digger" or "Smith" - descriptive titles. Upon proving their skill, they earn a real name, often incorporating their specialty and an admired trait: "Snapjaw the Clever Trapmaker" or "Bright-Scale the Precise Engineer." The name announces what they achieved and how they did it.

Losing one's earned name - through disgrace or failure - is psychologically devastating. The kobold reverts to a generic title, essentially becoming nobody. Earning back a name requires proving worth all over again. This creates intense pressure to maintain standards and avoid mistakes.

### Surface Relations

Kobolds who work regularly on the surface develop tricks for coping with sunlight, open spaces, and surface dwellers' strange ways. They wear protective gear, memorize safe spots in cities, and learn to interpret surface races' bizarre emphasis on eye contact and facial expressions. It's exhausting, like constantly translating between languages, but necessary for trade.

Surface races that understand kobold value make accommodation - providing shaded meeting areas, conducting business in evening hours, respecting warren territorial boundaries. These small courtesies build lasting partnerships. Settlements that don't bother find themselves without access to exceptional kobold craftsmanship.

### Future Dreaming

Despite their focus on practical work, kobolds maintain a collective dream: to achieve draconic standards of excellence. No kobold believes their warren matches a dragon's lair, their hoard equals a dragon's treasure, or their craftsmanship reaches draconic perfection. But maybe the next generation will get closer. Maybe the generation after that. Maybe, centuries from now, dragons will look at kobold work and nod in recognition.

It's an impossible dream, but it drives kobolds forward. Better traps, deeper warrens, more clever mechanisms - all in service of eventually earning dragons' respect. Whether any dragon would actually care doesn't matter. The dream itself gives kobold culture direction and meaning.
