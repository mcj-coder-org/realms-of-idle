# Trolls

## Lore

### Origin

Trolls are nature's answer to the question "what if we made something nearly unkillable?" Standing eight to ten feet tall, covered in thick warty hide, with long arms, stooped postures, and mouths full of mismatched teeth, trolls look like something evolution designed specifically for surviving violence. And that's exactly what they are.

The defining characteristic of trolls is regeneration. Cut off a troll's arm and it grows back within hours. Stab a troll through the chest and the wound closes before your eyes. Break troll bones and they knit themselves whole. Only fire and acid prevent this regeneration, making trolls vulnerable to specific threats while nearly immune to everything else. This regeneration comes with cost - trolls are perpetually hungry, their accelerated healing demanding enormous caloric intake.

Calling trolls "barely sentient" seems cruel but it's accurate. Trolls think, communicate, and reason, but at the most primitive levels of any sapient race. They understand basic concepts like "mine," "hungry," "danger," and "hurt." Abstract ideas like honor, loyalty, or planning beyond immediate needs largely escape them. They're smart enough to learn from experience, remember individuals, and solve simple problems. They're not smart enough for complex social structures, sophisticated tool use, or anything resembling civilization.

[Shamanic magic](../../../systems/character/index.md) barely exists among trolls - occasional individuals show instinctive connection to spirits, performing crude rituals they don't fully understand. Calling these individuals "shamans" feels generous; they're trolls who happen to have spiritual sensitivity without the cognitive capacity to develop it meaningfully.

### In the World

Trolls occupy the most isolated territories - deep wilderness where even other tribal races don't venture. They don't build, don't farm, don't maintain territories in any organized sense. They hunt, eat, sleep, and reproduce, following patterns that barely qualify as culture. "Troll territory" means "places where trolls have been seen" rather than claimed domains they defend.

The relationship between trolls and everyone else is simple: mutual avoidance punctuated by violence. [Settlements](../../../systems/world/settlements/index.md) hire adventurers to eliminate trolls that wander too close. Trolls attack anything that looks edible or threatens them. There's no diplomacy, no negotiation, no peaceful coexistence - trolls lack the mental capacity for diplomatic relationships.

Other races view trolls as monsters, not people. [Humans](../../enlightened/humans/) fear them as embodiments of unkillable hunger. [Dwarves](../../enlightened/dwarves/) seal mines when trolls move in, considering it cheaper than elimination. [Elves](../../enlightened/elves/) maintain barriers around forests to keep trolls out. Even [orcs](../orcs/) and [ogres](../ogres/) avoid trolls when possible - fighting regenerating giants is expensive in lives and resources.

Troll social structure barely exists. They form small family bands - usually a mated pair and their young, occasionally a few related individuals. These bands aren't tribes in any meaningful sense; they're just trolls who tolerate each other's presence. Leadership goes to whoever's biggest and most aggressive, maintained through casual violence rather than any authority structure.

Trolls reproduce slowly and care for young longer than their intelligence suggests they should. Young trolls stay with parents for years, learning through observation and crude instruction. This minimal parenting is enough because trolls don't need complex skills - hunt, eat, avoid fire, regenerate injuries. That's the entire curriculum.

See [Racial Synergies](../../../systems/character/racial-synergies/index.md) for detailed mechanics.

### Racial Skills

**Skill Pool Tags:** `Physical/Endurance`, `Physical/Strength`, `Nature`, `Combat`, `Physical`

Trolls receive **3 random skills** from their racial skill pool at character creation, with additional skills available at racial milestone levels (10, 25, 50). Skills must match at least one of the pool tags above.

**Example Racial Skills:**

| Skill                                                                                 | Tags                         | Effect                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| [Rapid Regeneration](../../../content/skills/passive/rapid-regeneration/index.md)     | Physical/Endurance, Nature   | Heal 5%/2% max HP per minute (out/in combat)      |
| [Thick Skin](../../../content/skills/passive/thick-skin/index.md)                     | Physical/Endurance, Physical | +2 AC natural armor, 5% damage reduction          |
| [Relentless Endurance](../../../content/skills/passive/relentless-endurance/index.md) | Physical/Endurance, Combat   | Survive lethal damage at 1 HP once per day        |
| [Massive Frame](../../../content/skills/racial/index.md)                              | Physical/Strength, Physical  | +40% HP, +75% carry capacity, Large size benefits |
| [Powerful Build](../../../content/skills/racial/index.md)                             | Physical/Strength            | +25% melee damage, enhanced strength checks       |
| [Keen Smell](../../../content/skills/index.md)                                        | Nature, Physical             | Track by scent, detect hidden creatures           |

**[Rapid Regeneration](../../../content/skills/passive/rapid-regeneration/index.md)**: Trolls heal constantly and rapidly. They regenerate 5% max HP per minute out of combat and 2% per minute even during battle. Minor wounds close within minutes, major injuries within hours. This makes trolls incredibly difficult to kill through conventional [combat](../../../systems/combat/index.md). Fire and acid damage prevent regeneration - trolls instinctively fear both.

**[Thick Skin](../../../content/skills/passive/thick-skin/index.md)**: Troll hide is tough as leather armor, providing +2 AC natural protection and 5% physical damage reduction. Even without worn armor (which trolls rarely understand), they shrug off blows that would devastate other races.

**[Relentless Endurance](../../../content/skills/passive/relentless-endurance/index.md)**: Combined with regeneration, this makes trolls nearly unkillable. Once per long rest, when reduced to 0 HP, a troll survives with 1 HP and immediately begins regenerating. The only reliable way to kill a troll is fire or acid.

**[Massive Frame](../../../content/skills/racial/index.md)**: Being huge (Large size category) gives trolls massive health pools (+40% HP) and reach advantages in [combat](../../../systems/combat/index.md). They carry extraordinary loads (+75% capacity). But their size makes them easy targets and prevents them from using structures designed for smaller races. Trolls simply don't fit in normal buildings.

**[Powerful Build](../../../content/skills/racial/index.md)**: Trolls are monumentally strong, capable of feats no other race can match. They tear apart fortifications, uproot trees, and throw boulders like humans throw stones. Enhanced strength checks and +25% melee damage make troll strength nearly unstoppable.

**[Keen Smell](../../../content/skills/index.md)**: Trolls track prey by scent, detect hidden creatures, and navigate by smell. This compensates somewhat for their limited intelligence and provides significant hunting advantages.

**Limitations:**

- **Fire & Acid Vulnerability:** +50% damage from fire/acid, stops regeneration completely for 1 minute
- **Simple Mind:** Trolls cannot learn [magic](../../../systems/character/magic-system/index.md) meaningfully. Cognitive limitations prevent understanding magical concepts. Even [shamanic](../../../systems/character/index.md) abilities remain rudimentary.
- **Very Monstrous:** [Faction](../../../systems/social/factions-reputation/index.md) standings start at "kill on sight" in virtually all settlements. Overcoming this is nearly impossible; trolls lack intelligence to demonstrate trustworthiness consistently.

### Regional Variants

| Variant        | Region       | Adaptation        | Special Traits               |
| -------------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Forest Troll   | Dense woods  | Tree climbing     | +15% stealth in forest       |
| Mountain Troll | High country | Cold adaptation   | +25% cold resistance, fur    |
| Swamp Troll    | Wetlands     | Aquatic           | Can breathe underwater       |
| Cave Troll     | Underground  | Light sensitivity | Darkvision, sunlight penalty |

**Forest Trolls** adapted to woodland environments, becoming adept climbers despite their size. They hunt from trees, dropping onto prey with devastating impact.

**Mountain Trolls** grew thick fur and adapted to extreme cold. They're bulkier than other trolls, sacrificing speed for insulation. Ice and snow don't slow them.

**Swamp Trolls** developed ability to breathe underwater, making them nearly impossible to escape in wetlands. They're slimmer, with webbed fingers and toes, and can wait submerged for hours before striking.

**Cave Trolls** adapted to underground life, developing darkvision but becoming sensitive to bright light. They're the most isolated troll variant, rarely emerging to surface.

### Interactions

| System         | Interaction                                    |

| Magic          | No magical capability                          |
| Crafting       | Cannot craft beyond crudest tools              |
| Settlement     | Family bands, no permanent structures          |

## Available Classes

Trolls technically have access to all character classes, but their extreme cognitive limitations make meaningful class participation impossible:

- **[Fighter](../../../../classes/fighter/)**: Only path trolls can conceivably follow (warrior variant only)
- **[Mage](../../../../classes/channeler/mage/)**: Cannot learn - completely lacks capacity for magic
- **[Shaman](../../../../classes/spiritcaller/shaman/)**: Cannot learn - minimal shamanic sensitivity, insufficient intelligence
- **[Crafter](../../../../classes/crafter/)**: Cannot learn - lacks fine motor control and understanding
- **[Consolidation](../../../../classes/consolidation/)**: Cannot learn - multiple disciplines impossible
- **[Economic](../../../../classes/economic/)**: Cannot learn - lacks concept of commerce

**Reality:** Trolls function as highly effective but mindless combat units. They cannot truly "learn" classes in the conventional sense. Instead:

- **Warrior Path Only**: Trolls can develop as warriors through combat experience and instinct
- **No Class Skills**: Trolls don't gain class abilities requiring understanding; their racial skills are their only advancement
- **Instinctive Combat**: Trolls improve in combat through raw experience, becoming more dangerous through practice
- **Permanent Simplicity**: No trolls achieve higher sophistication regardless of age or experience
- **Mercenary Use**: Trolls serve as grunt soldiers or enforcers when bound/controlled, but cannot execute strategic decisions

## Cultural Notes

### The Hunger

Troll regeneration demands constant fuel. A regenerating troll burns calories at incredible rates - healing a major wound might require consuming an entire deer. This creates perpetual hunger that drives much troll behavior. Trolls are always looking for their next meal, always eating when food is available, always willing to fight for food sources.

This hunger makes trolls dangerous to everyone. Livestock, wild game, lone travelers, poorly defended settlements - everything looks like potential food to hungry trolls. They don't raid from malice or conquest; they raid because they're hungry and regeneration makes them hard to stop.

### Minimal Intelligence

Trolls exist at the borderline of sapience. They use simple tools - clubs, rocks, maybe a sharpened stick - but don't craft them with any skill. They communicate through grunts, gestures, and basic words, lacking vocabulary for abstract concepts. They remember faces, locations, and whether something hurt or helped them, but don't form complex memories or plans.

This minimal intelligence creates ethical questions other races prefer not to address. Are trolls people who deserve rights, or are they animals that happen to walk upright and speak broken language? Different cultures answer differently, but most settle on "dangerous enough that distinctions don't matter."

### Family Bonds

The one aspect of troll behavior that suggests deeper capacity is their family bonds. Troll mates stay together for years, caring for young jointly. Parents defend offspring ferociously, teaching them (as much as trolls teach anything) about survival. Siblings remember each other into adulthood.

These bonds aren't sophisticated - trolls don't express love verbally or demonstrate affection in ways other races recognize. But a troll will seek vengeance for killed family, will share food with mate and young, will remain in familiar territories where family members have been. It's primitive loyalty, but it's loyalty.

### The Fire Terror

All trolls fear fire instinctively. Show a troll open flame and it retreats. Set a troll ablaze and it panics, fleeing rather than fighting. This fear is biological, not learned - even young trolls never exposed to fire react with terror when first encountering it.

This vulnerability makes fire the primary anti-troll weapon. Settlements troubled by trolls hire adventurers with fire [magic](../../../systems/character/magic-system/index.md) or alchemical incendiaries. Farmers maintain signal fires to warn of troll approach. Foresters carry fire-starting kits as standard equipment. Fire keeps trolls at bay better than any fortification.

### Longevity Without Progress

Trolls can live two centuries if not killed, but this longevity produces no wisdom, no cultural accumulation, no progress. A two-hundred-year-old troll is exactly as intelligent as a twenty-year-old troll - regeneration keeps them physically capable but doesn't enhance mental capacity.

This creates strange situations where ancient trolls exist without being elders in any meaningful sense. They remember more (vaguely) and have learned a few more survival tricks, but they're not wiser, don't lead others, and haven't developed beyond basic troll nature. They're just old, regenerating, perpetually hungry giants wandering territory they've haunted for generations.

### Cannot Be Civilized

Some idealistic thinkers believe trolls could be educated, civilized, integrated if given proper opportunity. These attempts always fail. Trolls lack cognitive capacity for education beyond the simplest conditioning. You can teach a troll to associate a bell with feeding time, or to avoid certain areas after punishment. You cannot teach them to read, understand contracts, or make complex decisions.

The cruelest attempts involve keeping trolls as exhibits or experimental subjects. Regeneration makes trolls ideal for certain types of research - they survive procedures that would kill others. Whether this constitutes torture depends on whether you consider trolls sapient enough to suffer psychologically beyond physical pain. Most prefer not to think about it.

### The Troll Problem

What do you do about trolls? They're strong enough to threaten settlements, regenerating enough to survive elimination attempts, simple enough to be unpredictable, and long-lived enough to be persistent threats. Yet they're intelligent enough to communicate, form families, and remember grudges. Are they people deserving protection or monsters requiring elimination?

[Settlements](../../../systems/world/settlements/index.md) typically treat trolls as dangerous wildlife - avoid when possible, eliminate when necessary, don't lose sleep over moral implications. A few philosophers argue for troll rights, pointing to their undeniable sapience. Most people, especially those who've seen troll attacks, consider this absurd philosophy that ignores reality.

### Ecological Role

Trolls serve as apex predators in regions too harsh for other races. They control populations of large game animals, prevent lesser predators from becoming too numerous, and clear out sickly or weak individuals through predation. In pure wilderness terms, trolls fill necessary ecological niche.

But ecosystems don't care about sentience. The fact that trolls are barely sapient and might deserve consideration as people doesn't change that they eat livestock, attack travelers, and make certain territories too dangerous to settle. Their ecological value doesn't outweigh their threat to civilization, so civilization acts accordingly.

### Future Without Hope

Trolls have no future beyond continuing as they have - scattered family bands in deep wilderness, occasional violent encounters with civilization, slow decline as habitable territories shrink. They cannot adapt, cannot integrate, cannot change enough to survive in worlds increasingly shaped by more intelligent races.

Eventually, trolls will exist only in the most isolated regions, if at all. Some might survive in preserves or protected wilderness, viewed as living fossils from more primitive ages. Most will be killed when they inevitably conflict with expanding civilization. And because trolls cannot comprehend their situation or organize meaningful response, they'll disappear without even understanding why they're dying out.

It's a grim fate, made grimmer by the fact that trolls are just smart enough to be aware something is wrong but not smart enough to do anything about it. They're evolution's mistake - beings who regenerate bodies but not societies, who survive individually but cannot thrive collectively, who occupy the worst possible position on the spectrum between beast and person.
