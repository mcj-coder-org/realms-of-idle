# Urban Goblin

> **Parent Race:** [Goblins](base/index.md)

## Variant Overview

Urban Goblins have achieved what many consider impossible - functional integration with settled society despite pervasive prejudice. They inhabit city fringes, sewer systems, abandoned districts, and the overlooked spaces where official society doesn't reach. Through necessity, talent, and their unique shared memory advantage, they've become the information brokers, fixers, and facilitators of services that civilized society needs but won't officially acknowledge.

## Region

Cities and large settlements, specifically the marginal spaces - sewers, abandoned buildings, slum districts, warehouse districts, and the twilight zone between official neighborhoods and complete abandonment. Urban Goblins don't live in respectable areas, but they live in proximity to them, maintaining access to the economic opportunities and information flows that cities provide.

## Specialization

Information brokering, theft, smuggling, and facilitating unofficial transactions. Urban Goblins possess encyclopedic knowledge of city layouts, guard patrol patterns, criminal networks, and who wants what they're not supposed to have. Their shared memory transforms every tribe member into a node in a distributed intelligence network that would cost fortunes to replicate through conventional means.

## Cultural Distinctions

Urban Goblins live the goblin paradox most intensely. They're simultaneously the most integrated and still fundamentally outcast. They interact with settled society daily - buying food, negotiating contracts, passing information - but they're never truly accepted. They've learned to navigate this contradiction through professionalism, reliability, and making themselves valuable enough that prejudice takes second place to utility.

Their tribes function as distributed organizations more than traditional communities. Individual goblins take on specific roles - scouts, thieves, information gatherers, negotiators - but shared memory means every goblin has access to every other goblin's knowledge and experiences. A goblin negotiating a deal knows everything the scouts discovered, what the thieves observed, and what other negotiators have learned from similar situations.

This organizational structure makes Urban Goblin tribes extraordinarily efficient. They coordinate operations that would require extensive planning and communication for other groups through simple shared awareness. A theft opportunity identified by one goblin can be exploited by another within minutes, with perfect knowledge transfer requiring no spoken words or written messages.

### Enhanced Social Skills

The +15% social skill bonus represents generations of adaptation to city life. Urban Goblins have learned to read surface-dweller body language, recognize social hierarchies, navigate cultural expectations, and communicate in ways that minimize prejudice-driven friction. They're not naturally charismatic - goblin biology doesn't change - but they've developed sophisticated cultural protocols for managing interactions.

These skills manifest as professional demeanor, careful word choice, and understanding when to show deference versus confidence. An Urban Goblin negotiating with a merchant presents differently than one dealing with guards or another dealing with fellow criminals. This adaptability comes from collective experience - every interaction any tribe member has ever had informs every future interaction.

Young Urban Goblins learn city navigation and social protocols simultaneously, guided by tribal memory that contains centuries of accumulated experience. They know which streets to avoid, which guards take bribes, which merchants treat goblins fairly, and which areas tolerate goblin presence. This knowledge updates constantly as conditions change.

### Information Economy

Urban Goblins turned shared memory into their primary trade good. Pay one goblin for information and you're accessing a distributed intelligence network spanning the entire city. The goblin you're talking to knows what goblins in the docks saw this morning, what goblins in the merchant district overheard yesterday, and what patterns goblins in the warehouse district have noticed over weeks.

This information network operates at speeds conventional intelligence gathering can't match. When something significant happens anywhere in the city, Urban Goblins know within hours - faster if tribe members witnessed it directly. They don't need to send messages or file reports; the information simply propagates through shared consciousness.

The value of this capability makes Urban Goblins simultaneously indispensable and frightening. Merchants, nobles, and criminals all use goblin information services while being profoundly uncomfortable with the mechanism. The same shared memory that makes goblins valuable also means you can never truly keep secrets from a tribe - if one goblin learns something, they all know.

### Underworld Operations

Urban Goblins don't control criminal activities, but they're often essential facilitators. Need to smuggle goods past checkpoints? Goblins know the guard schedules and unmonitored routes. Need items moved quickly and quietly? Goblins coordinate through shared memory with perfect efficiency. Need to know who's buying, selling, or looking for something specific? Goblins maintain networks spanning the entire city.

They operate through pragmatic ethics rather than moral principles. Urban Goblins don't particularly care whether goods are legal or illegal, transactions legitimate or corrupt. They care whether clients pay fairly, keep agreements, and don't bring heat down on goblin operations. Break those rules and Urban Goblins remember - and every goblin in the city knows to avoid you.

This reputation for reliability makes Urban Goblins trusted in paradoxical ways. A merchant wouldn't invite a goblin to dinner but will trust them with valuable shipments because goblins honor contracts absolutely. A noble wouldn't acknowledge knowing goblins but pays them regularly for information. The hypocrisy bothers goblins less than surface folk would expect - they're pragmatists first.

## Relations

**With Other Goblins:** Urban Goblins occupy an ambiguous position among goblin variants. Cave and Swamp Goblins consider them compromised by excessive surface contact. Mountain Goblins respect their success but question the cost. Urban Goblins view themselves as pragmatists making the best of outcast status - if you can't escape prejudice, you might as well profit from it.

**With Other Races:** Urban Goblins maintain complex relationships with [humans](../../enlightened/humans/index.md) - simultaneously customers, employers, threats, and sources of constant low-level prejudice. They avoid [dwarves](../../enlightened/dwarves/index.md) who universally distrust them. They respect [kobolds](../../enlightened/kobolds/index.md) as fellow small folk surviving through cleverness. They treat criminal [humans](../../enlightened/humans/index.md) as business partners while remaining wary of betrayal.

## Shared Memory in Cities

Urban Goblin shared memory functions identically to other variants mechanically, but urban environments present unique advantages and challenges. Buildings and crowds obscure line-of-sight, reducing perfect clarity range. However, dense goblin populations mean tribal members are often within the "clear" communication range despite urban obstacles.

The urban environment also provides practical communication advantages. A goblin in the market district instantly knows what's happening in the warehouse district because tribe members in both locations maintain constant connection. This city-wide awareness makes Urban Goblin intelligence gathering impossibly fast by conventional standards.

Urban tribes sometimes develop sophisticated mental protocols for managing information overload. When dozens of tribe members experience different things simultaneously, learning to filter shared experience for relevance becomes essential. Urban Goblins describe this as similar to tuning out background conversation while focusing on important dialogue.

## Recommended Classes

Urban Goblins excel at classes that leverage social skills and information advantages:

- **[Rogue](../../../classes/combat/index.md)**: Natural fit, specializing in theft, infiltration, and urban operations
- **[Scout](../../../classes/combat/index.md)**: City navigation and reconnaissance specialists
- **[Merchant](../../../classes/../systems/social/index.md)**: Information brokers and underground traders
- **[Spy](../../../classes/../systems/social/index.md)**: Intelligence gatherers with perfect information sharing
- **[Shaman](../../../classes/magic/index.md)**: Rare but respected tribal leaders managing collective welfare

More suitable for social and intrigue-focused campaigns than pure combat scenarios. Their enhanced social skills and information networks shine in urban environments but provide less advantage in wilderness or dungeon settings.

## Roleplaying Considerations

Urban Goblins offer opportunities to explore integration, prejudice, and finding dignity in circumstances others consider shameful. They're survivors who've turned outcast status into economic opportunity, demonstrating that success doesn't require acceptance. Their work in gray markets and underworld operations raises questions about legality versus morality, and whether being "useful" matters if you're still not "welcome."

Their enhanced social skills create interesting contrasts - a goblin who can read a noble's intentions perfectly but will never be invited through the front door. They understand society intimately while remaining fundamentally excluded from it. This contradiction drives Urban Goblin psychology and motivations.

Urban Goblin characters might seek genuine acceptance rather than grudging tolerance, work to improve goblin reputation through demonstrated reliability, navigate the tensions between criminal activities and honorable aspirations, or simply maximize profit from their unique capabilities while society remains hostile.

The information network provides excellent roleplay opportunities - having one tribe member learn something while adventuring allows their entire tribe to know, creating story hooks and complications when that information spreads or gets used in unexpected ways.
