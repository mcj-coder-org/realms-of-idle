# Mountain Goblin

> **Parent Race:** [Goblins](base/index.md)

## Variant Overview

Mountain Goblins occupy the high country - steep slopes, narrow passes, and treacherous peaks where sure footing and route knowledge mean the difference between safe passage and fatal falls. They've carved out an unusual niche among goblin variants: providing essential services valuable enough that mountain settlements and even [dwarven](../../enlightened/dwarves/index.md) holds grudgingly tolerate their presence. Through demonstrated reliability and expertise that larger races struggle to match in extreme terrain, Mountain Goblins have achieved the closest thing to acceptance any goblin variant knows.

## Region

Mountain ranges, high-altitude valleys, cliff faces, and narrow passes. Mountain Goblins inhabit areas where vertical terrain dominates - places where paths wind along cliff edges, where rockfalls threaten constantly, and where altitude and weather create challenges beyond simple navigation. They establish tribal camps in caves, overhangs, and protected valleys, positioning themselves along routes that see regular traffic.

## Specialization

Mountain guiding, climbing, route-finding, and high-altitude survival. Mountain Goblins possess encyclopedic knowledge of mountain routes, seasonal weather patterns, avalanche risks, and safe passage through terrain that changes with every storm. Their small size and natural agility make them exceptional climbers, able to navigate routes that would challenge or kill larger travelers. Combined with shared memory, every tribe member has perfect knowledge of every route any goblin has explored.

## Cultural Distinctions

Mountain Goblins live by a code of professional reliability that sets them apart from other goblin variants. They understand that their position depends entirely on reputation - a single failed guide contract could destroy decades of trust-building. This creates a culture of meticulous preparation, conservative risk assessment, and absolute honesty about route conditions and dangers.

Their tribes function as cooperative guide services, with shared memory meaning every goblin has access to current route information. When weather changes a pass, when rockfall blocks a trail, when seasonal snow opens or closes routes - the information propagates through tribal memory instantly. A goblin who's never personally traveled a specific route can still guide clients accurately using shared knowledge from tribe members who have.

This professional focus shapes everything about Mountain Goblin culture. They're not trying to overcome prejudice through politics or integration - they're doing it through being so useful that excluding them would be foolish. It's a pragmatic approach that's achieved better results than any other goblin variant has managed.

### Enhanced Climbing

The +15% climbing bonus represents both natural adaptation to mountain life and accumulated expertise. Mountain Goblins learn climbing from childhood, with young goblins practicing on increasingly difficult faces under supervision of tribal elders whose decades of experience flow through shared memory. Every successful technique, every near-miss, every tragedy from taking unnecessary risks - all contribute to collective expertise.

This enhancement manifests as confidence on vertical terrain that seems supernatural to watching clients. Mountain Goblins scramble up cliff faces without hesitation, identify handholds by instinct (really accumulated pattern recognition), and judge rock stability with casual glances. They rope up clients and lead them along narrow ledges while chatting casually about weather or wildlife, demonstrating comfort that makes the dangerous feel routine.

Their small size provides genuine advantages on vertical terrain. Lower centers of gravity make them more stable, smaller frames require less secure holds, and their weight puts less stress on questionable routes. What challenges larger races barely inconveniences Mountain Goblins, allowing them to guide parties through terrain the parties couldn't safely navigate alone.

### Guide Services

Mountain Goblins have turned their environmental expertise into their primary trade. Merchants hiring goblin guides to lead caravans through mountain passes pay premium rates for guaranteed safe passage. Adventurers employ goblins to navigate routes to remote locations. Even [dwarven](../../enlightened/dwarves/index.md) expeditions occasionally hire Mountain Goblins as scouts when exploring new territories.

The shared memory advantage makes goblin guides extraordinarily reliable. If any tribe member has traveled a route, every goblin can guide it perfectly. Current conditions update constantly - a goblin scouting ahead shares what they see in real-time with the goblin leading the main party. This allows instant route adjustment when conditions change, avoiding dangers that would catch conventional guides by surprise.

Mountain Goblins maintain strict professional ethics around guide work. They never steal from clients, never abandon parties in dangerous situations, and provide honest assessments of risks even when that means losing contracts. This reliability is calculated - one betrayal would destroy the reputation entire tribes depend on - but it's also become genuinely cultural. Mountain Goblins take pride in their professional standards.

### Route Knowledge

Every Mountain Goblin possesses perfect knowledge of every route their tribe has explored. This collective expertise accumulates over generations - routes first scouted by long-dead goblins remain in tribal memory, updated continuously as conditions change. The result is geographic knowledge that would take conventional cartographers decades to compile and update.

This knowledge extends beyond simple navigation. Mountain Goblins know seasonal patterns - which passes close when, where avalanche risk peaks, when rivers swell too deep to ford. They know wildlife behavior - where mountain predators hunt, which areas attract territorial creatures, what signs indicate dangerous animals nearby. They know weather patterns - how clouds forming over specific peaks predict storms, what wind directions signal approaching weather changes.

Clients paying for goblin guides aren't just buying navigation - they're accessing centuries of accumulated environmental expertise shared through biological means impossible for other races to replicate.

### Building Reputation

Mountain Goblins are acutely aware that their position depends on reputation. They work constantly to build and maintain trust, knowing that prejudice waits for any excuse to reassert itself. This creates a cautious, conservative approach where refusing dangerous contracts is preferable to attempting them and failing.

They navigate a careful balance - demonstrating expertise without seeming threatening, providing essential services while remaining deferential, being valuable enough to tolerate but not successful enough to trigger resentment. It's exhausting but effective. Mountain Goblin tribes maintain relationships with mountain settlements that would never tolerate other goblin variants.

## Relations

**With Other Goblins:** Mountain Goblins occupy a respected but somewhat separate position among goblin variants. Other goblins admire their relative acceptance while questioning whether serving surface folk so directly compromises goblin dignity. Mountain Goblins respond pragmatically - they're still outcast by any absolute measure, just less excluded than alternatives. They maintain good relations with all variants, serving as occasional intermediaries.

**With Other Races:** Mountain Goblins have the best inter-racial relationships of any goblin variant. [Dwarves](../../enlightened/dwarves/index.md) grudgingly respect their mountain expertise while maintaining overall goblin prejudice. [Humans](../../enlightened/humans/index.md) hire them regularly for guide services while still not welcoming them socially. Mountain [settlements](../../../systems/world/settlements/index.md) tolerate their presence as useful locals rather than threatening outsiders. It's not acceptance, but it's dramatically better than most goblins experience.

## Shared Memory in Mountains

Mountain Goblin shared memory functions identically to other variants mechanically, but mountain environments affect its tactical applications. Line-of-sight across mountain terrain can extend to exceptional distances - a goblin on one peak can clearly see a tribe member on another peak miles away, maintaining perfect mental connection despite physical separation.

This extended visual range makes Mountain Goblin coordination particularly effective in their environment. Scouts positioned on high points provide real-time reconnaissance to entire tribes simultaneously. Guides leading parties can receive updates from forward scouts instantly. The mountain environment, rather than limiting shared memory, actually enhances its practical utility.

Mountain tribes also use shared memory for safety. When one goblin encounters a hazard - unstable route, aggressive wildlife, unexpected weather - every tribe member knows immediately. This collective awareness has saved countless goblin lives over generations, making it not just a coordination tool but a survival mechanism.

## Recommended Classes

Mountain Goblins excel at classes that leverage climbing expertise and environmental knowledge:

- **[Scout](../../../classes/combat/index.md)**: Natural fit, specializing in mountain navigation and reconnaissance
- **[Guide](../../../classes/../systems/social/index.md)**: Professional route-finders and survival specialists
- **[Ranger](../../../classes/combat/index.md)**: Mountain specialists and wilderness experts
- **[Shaman](../../../classes/magic/index.md)**: Tribal practitioners maintaining spiritual connections
- **[Climber](../../../classes/combat/index.md)**: Vertical terrain specialists and rescue experts

Less suitable for heavy armor classes due to climbing limitations. Their climbing bonus and route knowledge shine in mountain and vertical terrain but provide less advantage in flatland or urban environments.

## Roleplaying Considerations

Mountain Goblins offer opportunities to explore earning respect through excellence, breaking stereotypes through demonstrated value, and the costs of constant professional vigilance. They're survivors who've found a sustainable niche by being so useful that prejudice can't fully exclude them. Their emphasis on reputation and reliability raises questions about whether proving yourself to people who should accept you anyway is victory or tragedy.

Their professional focus creates interesting character dynamics - a Mountain Goblin takes guide work seriously in ways that can seem obsessive to others, because their entire community's wellbeing depends on maintaining reputation. One failure reflects on all goblins, creating pressure that affects decision-making and risk assessment.

Mountain Goblin characters might seek to expand acceptance beyond mountain regions, prove that goblin reliability extends to all endeavors, build personal reputations that transcend racial prejudice, or simply excel at their craft while navigating the complexities of being tolerated rather than accepted.

The enhanced climbing and route knowledge provide excellent adventure opportunities - scaling sheer cliff faces, navigating treacherous passes, finding hidden routes to remote locations, or rescuing parties trapped by mountain hazards. Their shared memory means one goblin's successful exploration opens new routes for entire parties.
