# Goblins

## Lore

### Origin

Goblins occupy the most paradoxical position of any race - simultaneously the most coordinated and the most outcast. Their shared memory ability, allowing instant information sharing within tribes, should make them invaluable allies. Instead, it makes them terrifying to outsiders who can't fathom a group where individual privacy doesn't exist and where witnessing one goblin means alerting an entire tribe.

Nobody remembers when goblins first appeared, though legends suggest they were created by ancient [magic](./././././systems/character/magic-system/index.md) rather than evolving naturally. What's certain is that their shared memory is biological, not learned - young goblins instinctively connect to their tribe's collective consciousness. This connection shapes everything about goblin society, from their perfect coordination to their complete inability to keep secrets from each other.

Standing barely four feet tall with gray-green skin, pointed ears, and sharp features, goblins look mischievous even when behaving honorably. Their large eyes adapted for darkvision and their nimble fingers suited for delicate work make them excellent scouts and crafters. But these positive traits get overshadowed by the reputation: goblins are thieves, spies, smugglers, and troublemakers.

The cruel irony is that this reputation creates itself. [Settlements](./././././systems/world/settlements/index.md) exclude goblins, pushing them to margins and criminal activities. Goblin shared memory makes them extraordinarily effective at these activities - a goblin thief caught instantly shares guard positions with the whole tribe, goblin smugglers coordinate perfectly without verbal communication. Success at crime reinforces prejudice, which increases exclusion, which pushes more goblins into crime. The cycle perpetuates.

### In the World

Goblin tribes survive in the spaces society rejects - abandoned ruins, sewer systems, dense forests, mountain caves. They're not numerous individually, but goblin bands pop up everywhere, drawn to opportunities for survival and profit. A tribe might number twenty to eighty individuals, though their shared memory makes them function like a single distributed intelligence.

Different tribes develop different specializations based on their environment and opportunities. Urban goblins become fixers, information brokers, and handlers of goods that don't pass through official channels. Wilderness goblins serve as guides, scouts, and intermediaries between settlements and tribal races. Coastal goblins facilitate smuggling and unofficial trade. In each case, goblins turn their outcast status into an advantage - they can operate where official society can't or won't.

Other races have complicated, often contradictory views of goblins. [Humans](././enlightened/humans/) fear and despise them while grudgingly using their services when needed. [Dwarves](././enlightened/dwarves/) refuse goblin entry to holds, remembering ancient conflicts. [Elves](././enlightened/elves/) pity goblins as victims of their own nature. [Gnolls](./gnolls/) and [orcs](./orcs/) treat goblins as equals - outcasts recognize outcasts. [Kobolds](././enlightened/kobolds/) maintain wary respect for fellow small folk who survive through cleverness.

Within a goblin tribe, hierarchy exists but feels different from other races. The strongest fighters and cleverest planners lead, but leadership happens through consensus more than command - when everyone shares the same information and experiences, maintaining unpopular leadership becomes impossible. Tribal memory means every goblin knows exactly what the chief knows, understands their reasoning, and can judge decisions firsthand.

Goblin reproduction is rapid compared to other races - females can bear young yearly if conditions allow. This fast reproduction helps tribes recover from losses but also contributes to their outcast status. Settled folk fear being "overrun by goblins" if they allow unrestricted settlement, even though goblins don't actually desire conquest or displacement.

### Racial Skills

**Skill Pool Tags:** `Stealth`, `Physical/Agility`, `Crafting`, `Criminal`, `Gathering`

Goblins receive **3 random skills** from their racial skill pool at character creation, with additional skills available at racial milestone levels (10, 25, 50). Skills must match at least one of the pool tags above.

**Example Racial Skills:**

| Skill                                                                  | Tags                                   | Effect                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| [Nimble Escape](././././content/skills/passive/nimble-escape/index.md) | Physical/Agility, Stealth              | Disengage/Hide as bonus action          |
| [Pack Tactics](././././content/skills/passive/pack-tactics/index.md)   | Combat/Tactics, Tribal, Nature/Animals | +15% accuracy with nearby allies        |
| [Darkvision](././././content/skills/passive/darkvision/index.md)       | Physical, Universal/Physical           | Perfect vision in complete darkness     |
| [Scavenger](././././content/skills/common/index.md)                    | Gathering, Criminal                    | Find useful items others miss           |

| [Small Frame](././././content/skills/racial/index.md)                  | Physical/Agility                       | Harder to hit, fit through small spaces |

### Core Racial Abilities

**Shared Memory**: The defining goblin trait. Information learned by any tribe member enters the collective memory, accessible to all. Distance degrades clarity - perfect within sight, clear within the same area, fragmentary across regions. This enables perfect coordination in [combat](./././././systems/combat/index.md), instant communication, and collective decision-making. It also makes privacy impossible and secrets nearly so.

All goblin variants possess this ability, though environmental adaptations may affect its range or clarity in specific conditions.

**[Nimble Escape](././././content/skills/passive/nimble-escape/index.md)**: Goblins can Disengage or Hide as a bonus action instead of a full action. Combined with their small size and natural agility, this makes them incredibly difficult to pin down in [combat](./././././systems/combat/index.md). They dodge rather than tank damage, weaving through larger opponents.

**[Pack Tactics](././././content/skills/passive/pack-tactics/index.md)**: When a goblin has an ally within 5 feet of a target, they gain +15% accuracy on attacks. This reflects goblins' collective combat style - they fight as coordinated units, using shared memory to perfectly time attacks.

**[Darkvision](././././content/skills/passive/darkvision/index.md)**: Goblins see perfectly in absolute darkness, adapted for life in caves, ruins, and sewers. Bright daylight doesn't blind them but they prefer dimness, working most actively at dawn and dusk.

**[Scavenger](././././content/skills/common/index.md)**: Goblins possess intuitive understanding of value and utility. They find useful items others overlook, recognize salvageable materials, and maximize resource efficiency. This isn't genius - it's practical cleverness applied constantly to survival.

**[Trap Sense](././././content/skills/tiered/index.md)**: Goblins craft better [traps](./././././systems/index.md) (+10% effectiveness) and detect traps more reliably (+10% detection). They understand mechanical systems intuitively and exploit vulnerabilities naturally.

**[Small Frame](././././content/skills/racial/index.md)**: Standing four feet tall brings advantages - harder to hit (-10% enemy accuracy), fit through small spaces, less conspicuous - and disadvantages - weaker (-20% strength checks), easier to grapple, can't reach high places. Goblins compensate through cooperation and tool use.

**Shamanic Heritage:** Goblins have full access to [shamanic magic](./././././systems/character/index.md) through tribal spirit pools. Combined with shared memory, shamanic crafting unlocks eligibility for collective effort - one goblin crafts while others feed knowledge and guidance through the link.

**Outcast:** Most [settlements](./././././systems/world/settlements/index.md) treat goblins as unwelcome at best, hostile at worst. [Faction](./././././systems/social/factions-reputation/index.md) standings start significantly negative, requiring exceptional effort to overcome. This isn't just prejudice - it's active social exclusion backed by laws and customs.

## Cultural Notes

### The Shared Experience

Living with shared memory fundamentally alters goblin psychology. Privacy as other races understand it simply doesn't exist. Every tribe member's experiences, thoughts, and discoveries flow into the collective pool. This creates intense intimacy - goblins know each other completely - but also pressure. You can't hide feelings, fake enthusiasm, or maintain polite lies when everyone experiences your actual emotional state.

Young goblins learn early that mental discipline matters. You can't prevent information from entering shared memory, but you can learn to not dwell on things you'd prefer not to share. It's like learning not to stare - the capability exists, but social pressure teaches restraint. Still, truly keeping secrets is nearly impossible within a tribe.

### The Goblin Paradox

The cycle that defines goblin existence goes:

1. Settlements exclude goblins due to prejudice and fear
2. Exclusion forces goblins into criminal activities to survive
3. Shared memory makes goblins extraordinarily effective criminals
4. Criminal success reinforces prejudice and fear
5. Return to step 1

Breaking this cycle requires either settlements accepting goblins despite their nature (rare) or goblins abandoning shared memory (impossible - it's biological, not cultural). Progressive settlements try integration programs, but these often fail when a single goblin's crime instantly implicates the entire tribe through shared knowledge.

### Collective Decision-Making

Goblin tribes make decisions collectively because hiding dissent is futile. A chief might propose a plan, but every tribe member experiences the reasoning, understands the risks, and can judge for themselves. This creates consensus-based leadership that's remarkably effective but slow to respond to sudden changes.

When tribes split - over direction, philosophy, or practical necessity - the shared memory divides along loyalty lines. Goblins who leave together maintain connection; those who separate lose the link. Reconnection is possible but requires time and ritual reintegration.

### Information Economy

Goblins turned their shared memory into an economic advantage. A goblin information broker knows everything their tribe knows - and goblin tribes share information networks across regions. Pay one goblin for information and you're paying for a distributed intelligence network that would cost fortunes to replicate otherwise.

This makes goblins valuable despite prejudice. Need to know guard schedules? Ask a goblin. Want to smuggle goods past checkpoints? Goblins coordinate perfectly. Need to pass messages without official channels? Goblin networks operate faster than mounted couriers. The same traits that make goblins scary make them useful.

### Breaking Stereotypes

Not all goblins embrace criminal roles. Some tribes deliberately reject crime, seeking honorable integration even when settlements make it difficult. These goblins work twice as hard for half the respect, knowing one tribe member's crime reflects on all. They're tragic in their determination - trying to overcome prejudice that feeds on itself.

A few settlements embrace goblin integration, recognizing their value and working past fear. These places benefit from having perfectly coordinated workers, instant communication networks, and problem-solvers who share knowledge instantaneously. But such settlements remain exceptions.

### Emotional Resonance

Shared memory means shared emotion. When one goblin experiences joy, the tribe feels echoes. When one suffers, others feel shadows of that pain. This creates remarkable empathy within tribes but also emotional exhaustion. Goblins can't escape each other's feelings, leading to tribal "moods" that affect everyone.

Goblin shamans help manage this emotional resonance, performing rituals to calm collective anxiety or amplify shared celebration. Without shamanic guidance, tribes can spiral into collective despair or manic risk-taking as emotions feedback through shared connections.

### The Privacy Question

Young goblins sometimes wish for privacy, especially regarding romantic or personal matters. But shared memory doesn't distinguish - feelings are feelings, experiences are experiences. Tribes develop social conventions around "polite ignorance" - knowing something but acting like you don't - but it's a fiction everyone maintains while knowing everyone else knows.

This complete transparency prevents certain types of betrayal - you can't plan treason when everyone knows your thoughts - but it also prevents certain types of growth. Goblins can't secretly practice new skills, can't surprise tribe members, can't maintain any personal mystery. Everything is shared whether desired or not.

### Integration Challenges

Goblins trying to integrate with settled society face unique challenges. Their shared memory seems like telepathy to outsiders, creating fear and suspicion. Their coordination appears sinister even when innocent. Their need to regularly reconnect with tribes makes long-term settlement integration difficult.

The few goblins who succeed in settled life often cut themselves off from their tribes, accepting the psychological cost of isolation to gain acceptance. These individuals describe the experience as like losing part of themselves - going from distributed consciousness to lonely individuality. Many can't sustain it, returning to tribes even when it means returning to outcast status.

### Future Hopes

Some goblin tribes dream of full acceptance, of a future where shared memory is seen as advantage rather than threat. They point to goblin-integrated settlements as proof it's possible. They argue that goblin coordination could benefit everyone - imagine emergency response teams that communicate instantly, or collaborative projects where everyone shares the same mental model perfectly.

But most goblins are realists. They've lived with rejection too long to expect sudden change. Instead, they focus on survival, on carving out spaces where goblins can thrive despite exclusion, and on teaching next generations to navigate a world that fears them while depending on their services.
