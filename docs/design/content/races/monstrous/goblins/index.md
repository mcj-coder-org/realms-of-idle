## Shared Memory Across Variants

All goblin variants possess the defining racial trait: **Shared Memory**. This biological ability connects tribe members regardless of their environmental specialization. The core mechanics remain identical across variants:

- **Perfect clarity** within sight range
- **Clear communication** within the same area
- **Fragmentary connection** across regions
- **Instant information sharing** among all tribe members
- **Collective decision-making** through consensus
- **No privacy** within the tribe
- **Perfect combat coordination** when working together

Environmental specializations may affect the practical application of shared memory - urban goblins use it for information networks, cave goblins for mining coordination, swamp goblins for ambush timing, mountain goblins for guide reliability - but the underlying ability remains constant.

## The Outcast Experience

Regardless of variant, all goblins face the fundamental challenge of outcast status. Their shared memory makes them terrifying to outsiders and extraordinarily effective at activities that reinforce prejudice. The goblin paradox operates across all environments:

1. Society excludes goblins
2. Exclusion forces survival through marginal means
3. Shared memory makes goblins exceptionally effective
4. Success reinforces fear and prejudice
5. The cycle continues

Variant choice affects how goblins navigate this cycle, not whether they face it. Cave goblins isolate themselves, swamp goblins hide, urban goblins negotiate grudging tolerance, and mountain goblins prove their worth - but all remain fundamentally outcast.

## Available Classes

Goblins have **unrestricted access to all classes** with affinity to rogue and trader paths:

**All Classes Available**: Every class is accessible to goblins regardless of variant

- Goblins excel at: Thief, Fence, Smuggler, Merchant, Caravaner (rogue/trade focused)
- Goblins can access: All warrior, magic, crafting, gathering, and consolidation classes

**Goblin Class Paths**:

- **Rogue Classes**: Natural stealth and cunning make outlaw paths instinctive
- **Trader Classes**: Goblin adaptability and social flexibility excel in commerce
- **Shamanic Classes**: Some goblins find connection to spirits (less traditional)
- **Other Classes**: All fully accessible; renegade goblins become warriors, mages, or crafters

**Advantage**: Goblin cleverness and adaptability are perfectly suited to rogue and trading paths, but you're not limited to these choices. Many goblins surprise settlements by taking unexpected class paths.
