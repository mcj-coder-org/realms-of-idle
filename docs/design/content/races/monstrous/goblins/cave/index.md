# Cave Goblin

> **Parent Race:** [Goblins](base/index.md)

## Variant Overview

Cave Goblins represent the traditional goblin image - small figures lurking in abandoned mines, setting cunning traps in dark tunnels, and scavenging through ancient ruins. They've spent generations underground, adapting to absolute darkness and developing expertise in mining, trap-making, and subterranean survival. Their darkvision is the strongest of any goblin variant, allowing them to navigate pitch-black caverns with perfect clarity.

## Region

Underground cave systems, abandoned mines, ancient ruins, and natural cavern networks. Cave Goblins favor locations other races have abandoned or never fully explored - collapsed dwarven mines, pre-human ruins, limestone cave systems too unstable for permanent settlement. They turn these rejected spaces into fortified tribal homes, using natural defenses and cunning traps to protect their communities.

## Specialization

Mining, trap-making, and subterranean resource extraction. Cave Goblins possess intuitive understanding of tunnel stability, ore location, and cave ecology. They extract resources others miss or can't reach, salvage materials from ruins, and set traps that exploit three-dimensional underground environments. Their expertise makes them valuable (if unwelcome) experts on underground hazards and opportunities.

| Environment       | Underground caves, ruins, abandoned mines             |
| Cultural Emphasis | Traditional goblin lifestyle, minimal surface contact |
| Trade Specialty   | Ore, salvaged materials, underground intelligence     |
| Integration Level | Minimal (isolated from settled society)               |

## Cultural Distinctions

Cave Goblins live the most traditional goblin lifestyle, maintaining practices passed down through countless generations. Their tribes function as true collectives, with shared memory enabling perfect coordination in the three-dimensional maze of tunnels and caverns they call home.

They rarely venture to the surface except when necessity demands - when food grows scarce, when valuable salvage appears, or when negotiating with surface dwellers becomes unavoidable. Many surface folk go their entire lives without meeting a Cave Goblin, knowing them only through reputation and rumor.

Their isolation breeds suspicion from both sides. Cave Goblins view surface dwellers as unpredictable and potentially dangerous. Surface folk imagine Cave Goblins as creatures of darkness, plotting raids from underground lairs. The reality is more mundane - Cave Goblins mostly want to be left alone to work their mines and raise their young in peace.

### Mining and Salvage

Cave Goblins possess remarkable skill at identifying valuable materials in unlikely places. Where a [dwarf](../../enlightened/dwarves/index.md) sees a collapsed mine as lost investment, a Cave Goblin sees accessible ore veins and salvageable equipment. They work seams too narrow or dangerous for larger races, extract crystals from unstable caverns, and recover metals from flooded mine levels.

Their mining operates on different principles than dwarven methods. Dwarves build permanent infrastructure designed to last centuries. Cave Goblins create temporary, adaptive access - shoring up tunnels just long enough to extract resources, then abandoning them as they move to new opportunities. It's pragmatic rather than ambitious, focused on immediate survival rather than generational legacy.

### Enhanced Darkvision

The defining trait of Cave Goblins is their superior darkvision, adapted through countless generations in absolute darkness. Where typical goblin darkvision allows clear sight in darkness, Cave Goblin darkvision approaches supernatural clarity. They perceive detail, read expressions, and identify materials in pitch blackness that would leave even [dwarves](../../enlightened/dwarves/index.md) fumbling.

This enhanced vision comes with adaptation costs. Cave Goblins find bright daylight painful, not debilitating but intensely uncomfortable. They operate on the surface primarily during twilight hours, dawn and dusk, when light levels suit their preferences. Extended surface work requires protective eyewear or magical adaptation.

### Trap Expertise

Cave Goblins craft traps with three-dimensional thinking that frustrates surface-dwelling intruders. They exploit vertical drops, unstable floors, collapsing ceilings, and water-filled passages in ways that turn natural hazards into defensive systems. Their traps often appear crude - tripwires and falling rocks - but positioning and timing demonstrate sophisticated understanding of tunnel dynamics.

Shared memory makes trap placement devastatingly effective. Every tribe member knows the location and trigger mechanism of every trap. Cave Goblins navigate their own defenses with perfect confidence while intruders stumble into carefully positioned hazards. When one goblin spots an intruder, the entire tribe knows exactly where to lead them.

## Relations

**With Other Goblins:** Cave Goblins view themselves as maintaining true goblin traditions that other variants have compromised. They respect Swamp Goblins as fellow wilderness survivors but consider Urban Goblins corrupted by excessive contact with surface society. Mountain Goblins puzzle them - why work for surface dwellers when you could simply avoid them?

**With Other Races:** Cave Goblins maintain minimal contact with most races. They trade occasionally with [dwarves](../../enlightened/dwarves/index.md) despite mutual suspicion - dwarves need underground intelligence, goblins need surface goods. They avoid [humans](../../enlightened/humans/index.md) when possible, steal from them when necessary. They treat [kobolds](../../enlightened/kobolds/index.md) as fellow small underground-dwellers deserving wary respect.

## Shared Memory in Darkness

Cave Goblin shared memory functions identically to other variants in mechanics, but darkness affects its practical application. In pitch-black tunnels where other races can't see five feet ahead, Cave Goblins maintain perfect visual connection through their enhanced darkvision. This makes their coordination in underground environments particularly devastating.

Intruders carrying torches or magical light announce their presence while illuminating nothing useful - Cave Goblins see perfectly regardless. The tribe coordinates ambushes, trap activations, and tactical repositioning through shared memory while their targets fumble in inadequate light. This advantage makes Cave Goblin tribes nearly impossible to assault in their own territory.

## Recommended Classes

Cave Goblins excel at classes that leverage underground expertise and enhanced darkvision:

- **[Rogue](../../../classes/combat/index.md)**: Natural fit, using darkness and traps to devastating effect
- **[Scout](../../../classes/combat/index.md)**: Underground exploration and dungeon navigation specialists
- **[Shaman](../../../classes/magic/index.md)**: Tribal magic practitioners maintaining spiritual traditions
- **[Trapper](../../../classes/crafting/index.md)**: Master trap-makers using three-dimensional thinking
- **[Miner](../../../classes/crafting/index.md)**: Expert resource extractors finding value in abandoned places

Less suitable for social classes due to minimal settlement integration and pronounced outcast status. Their enhanced darkvision provides negligible advantage in well-lit civilized areas.

## Roleplaying Considerations

Cave Goblins offer opportunities to explore isolation, adaptation, and the challenges of living in rejected spaces. They're survivors who've turned disadvantage - exclusion from society - into advantage through specialized expertise. Their enhanced darkvision and underground skills make them exceptional in their element while highlighting their vulnerability elsewhere.

Their traditional lifestyle raises questions about preservation versus adaptation. Do Cave Goblins maintain ancient practices because they work, or because change seems threatening? Can isolated communities thrive indefinitely, or does refusing surface integration simply postpone inevitable conflict?

Cave Goblin characters might seek to prove their tribe's worth, establish trading relationships, explore the surface world with fresh eyes, or simply survive in a world that views them with fear and suspicion.
