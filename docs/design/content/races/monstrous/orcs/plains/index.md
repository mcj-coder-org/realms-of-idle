# Plains Orc

> **Parent Race:** [Orcs](base/index.md)

## Variant Overview

Plains Orcs represent the classic raider image that most settlements fear - mounted warriors thundering across grasslands, striking with overwhelming force, and vanishing before organized response can form. They breed massive wolves and boars as war mounts, creating cavalry that combines orc strength with animal ferocity. A plains orc war band on the move is a sight that empties villages and closes city gates.

Plains orc culture revolves around the mounted raid. Young orcs learn to ride before they can properly wield weapons. War mounts are treated as battle companions, not mere animals - fed before warriors eat, protected fiercely in combat, and honored in death. The bond between plains orc and mount is deep; many orcs claim to understand their mounts' thoughts, and the feeling might be mutual.

They maintain the traditional orc honor code with particular emphasis on open combat. Plains orcs consider striking from hiding cowardly (unlike their [swamp](swamp/index.md) cousins). They announce their presence with war cries and horn calls, giving opponents moments to prepare. This isn't mercy - it's honor. A victory against unprepared foes brings less glory than defeating those who fought back.

## Region

Open grasslands, prairies, and steppes where mobility matters more than fortification. Plains orc camps are temporary affairs - hide tents, portable cookfires, and corrals for war mounts. The tribe moves with the seasons, following game herds and raiding routes established over generations.

They claim vast territories but occupy them lightly, leaving few permanent structures. This mobility makes plains orcs difficult to pin down or eliminate - destroy one camp and the tribe has already moved. Settlements trying to defend against plains orcs face frustrating asymmetry: the orcs can strike anywhere, anytime, while defenders must guard everything always.

Some plains orc tribes maintain seasonal fortresses - defensible positions they return to during harsh winters or when resting between campaign seasons. These are pragmatic structures, not homes: earthworks, wooden palisades, and communal longhouses. They lack the permanence of [mountain orc](mountain/index.md) fortresses.

## Tactical Specialization

**Mounted Warfare Mastery**

Plains orcs excel at cavalry tactics that leverage speed and shock impact:

- **Thunderous Charge**: Full-speed cavalry charges that break enemy formations through sheer momentum. Plains orcs strike with lances and heavy weapons, relying on mount speed to amplify impact.

- **Hit-and-Run Raids**: Strike vulnerable positions, cause maximum disruption, withdraw before defenders consolidate. Plains orc war bands can attack, retreat, rest their mounts, and attack again while defenders are still organizing response.

- **Mounted Archery**: While plains orcs prefer melee, they practice mounted archery for harassing tactics and skirmishing. A retreating plains orc force still poses threat.

- **Mount Companion Fighting**: War mounts aren't just transportation - they're combat partners. Trained wolves and boars attack independently, creating two-front threat that overwhelms individual opponents.

- **Terrain Reading**: Plains orcs read grassland terrain like scholars read books. They know where ground supports cavalry charges, where hidden ditches wait, where defenders might prepare ambushes.

## Cultural Distinctions

Plains orcs maintain the most traditional orc culture. They preserve ancient raid routes, recite battle histories going back centuries, and follow honor codes with rigid adherence. Change happens slowly in plains orc society - what worked for ancestors works now.

**Mount Companions**: War mounts receive names, battle honors, and tribal recognition. When a mount dies in combat, plains orcs hold funerals with the same solemnity as for fallen warriors. The greatest mounts are remembered in tribal songs. Some legendary mounts have songs spanning generations - descendants of these honored beasts command premium prices.

**Raiding Season**: Plains orcs organize their year around raiding seasons. Spring raids target planting settlements while defenders are spread thin. Summer raids focus on trading caravans moving goods. Autumn raids coincide with harvest, when settlements have gathered wealth. Winter brings rest, mount breeding, and planning next year's campaigns.

**Honor Challenges**: Leadership challenges among plains orcs often happen mounted. Two rivals charge at each other with lances, first to unhorse opponent wins. This emphasizes that chiefs must excel at the tribe's core skill - mounted combat.

**Youth Trials**: Plains orc youths must complete the Ride - a solo journey covering hundreds of miles, living off the land, proving they can survive alone with only their mount. Those who return earn adult status. Those who don't return are mourned as honorable failures.

## Relations

**With Other Orc Variants:** Plains orcs view themselves as traditional "true" orcs. They respect [mountain orcs](mountain/index.md) but consider them too settled, losing touch with mobile warrior culture. [Desert orcs](desert/index.md) earn respect as fellow raiders, though plains orcs think desert tactics lack honor. [Swamp orcs](swamp/index.md) are viewed with suspicion - all that sneaking and ambushing seems dishonorable.

**With Other Races:** Plains orcs have the worst reputation among settled races - they're the ones who attack farms, burn villages, and disappear into grasslands. [Human](../../enlightened/humans/index.md) and [dwarf](../../enlightened/dwarves/index.md) military forces organize specifically to counter plains orc raids. [Nomadic humans](../../enlightened/humans/index.md) sometimes negotiate temporary truces, but settled folk see plains orcs as existential threat.

**Mount Trading**: Ironically, plains orcs' feared war mounts create odd trade opportunities. Wealthy warriors from other races pay fortunes for plains orc war wolves or boars. Some plains orc tribes engage in carefully managed mount trading - providing animals without training, ensuring buyers never master true plains orc cavalry techniques.

## Recommended Classes

Plains Orcs excel at mounted combat classes and leadership roles that leverage their cavalry expertise:

- **[Warrior](../../../classes/combat/index.md)**: Natural fit with mounted combat specialization
- **[Cavalry Commander](../../../classes/combat/index.md)**: Leads mounted war bands with devastating effectiveness
- **[Outrider](../../../classes/combat/index.md)**: Scout and raider combining mobility with combat skill
- **[Beast Master](../../../classes/combat/index.md)**: Specializes in mount companion fighting and animal tactics
- **[Warchief](../../../classes/combat/index.md)**: Tribal leadership focusing on raiding and mounted warfare
- **[Mounted Archer](../../../classes/combat/index.md)**: Combines riding skill with ranged harassment

Less suitable for magic-focused classes (due to racial magic penalties) or crafting specialists. Plains orcs can become [shamans](../../../classes/magic/index.md) but usually focus on war spirits and battle blessings rather than complex magical theory.
