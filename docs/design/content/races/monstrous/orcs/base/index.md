# Orcs

## Lore

### Origin

Orcs are strength made flesh - towering, muscular figures with gray-green skin, pronounced tusks, and eyes that burn with inner fire. They look every inch the savage warriors [settlements](../../../../../systems/world/settlements/index.md) fear them to be. And yes, orcs are warriors, bred for battle and raised in cultures that prize martial prowess above all else. But the word "savage" misses crucial truth: orc ferocity operates within rigid honor codes that govern every aspect of their lives.

Orc legends claim they were forged by ancient war gods to serve as perfect warriors. Whether literal or metaphorical, this origin story shapes orc identity profoundly. They see themselves as living weapons - tools of violence that must be aimed carefully, wielded skillfully, and respected properly. An orc without purpose is dangerous, like an unsheathed blade left lying around. An orc with clear purpose and worthy opponents thrives.

[Shamanic magic](../../../../../systems/character/index.md) flows through orc tribes, connecting warriors to their ancestors and tribal war spirits. Orc shamans don't just tend spiritual needs - they preserve battle histories, arbitrate honor disputes, and channel ancestral fury into warriors before combat. The greatest orc heroes become war spirits themselves after death, continuing to strengthen their tribes from beyond.

Orc reproduction follows a warrior culture pattern - females bear children but also fight alongside males, and both sexes can lead tribes through strength and cunning. Orc children grow quickly, reaching maturity around age ten and full strength by fifteen. This rapid development means orc tribes can recover from devastating defeats within a generation, contributing to other races' fear of orc persistence.

### In the World

Orc tribes occupy borderlands, wastelands, and contested territories - places where strength matters more than civilization. They don't farm extensively, preferring raiding, hunting, and taking what they need through force. This brings them into conflict with [settlements](../../../../../systems/world/settlements/index.md), creating cycles of violence that reinforce mutual hatred.

But orc raiding isn't random savagery - it follows rules. Honorable opponents get warnings before attacks. Defeated foes who surrender receive mercy (usually enslavement, but alive). Sacred sites and children remain off-limits. These rules mean little to victims, but they matter intensely to orcs. Breaking them brings shame that can haunt an orc for life.

Other races view orcs with fear and hostility. [Humans](../../enlightened/humans/) see them as barbaric raiders threatening civilization. [Dwarves](../../enlightened/dwarves/) remember ancient wars with orcs invading underground holds. [Elves](../../enlightened/elves/base/index.md) maintain eternal grudges against orc tribes that destroyed elven settlements centuries ago. [Gnolls](../gnolls/) respect orc martial prowess while avoiding territorial conflicts. [Goblins](../goblins/) sometimes ally with orc tribes, serving as scouts and intermediaries.

Orc tribal structure is militaristic but meritocratic. The strongest warrior becomes chief - but "strongest" means more than physical power. It means tactical ability, leadership skills, and maintaining honor codes. A physically weak but brilliant tactician can lead orcs if they prove their worth through victories. Challenges to leadership happen through ritual combat, ensuring chiefs maintain respect through demonstrated capability.

Most orc tribes number fifty to two hundred warriors plus non-combatants. Larger confederations form during major wars but typically fragment afterward - orcs struggle with complex hierarchies beyond the tribal level. Each tribe maintains fierce independence, allying temporarily for shared goals but never surrendering autonomy permanently.

### Racial Skills

**Skill Pool Tags:** `Combat`, `Physical/Strength`, `Physical/Endurance`, `Tribal`, `Physical`

Orcs receive **3 random skills** from their racial skill pool at character creation, with additional skills available at racial milestone levels (10, 25, 50). Skills must match at least one of the pool tags above.

**Example Racial Skills:**

| Skill                                                                                     | Tags                            | Effect                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| [Relentless Endurance](../../../../content/skills/passive/relentless-endurance/index.md)  | Physical/Endurance, Combat      | Survive lethal damage at 1 HP once per day        |
| [Savage Attacks](../../../../content/skills/passive/savage-attacks/index.md)              | Combat/Melee, Physical/Strength | Extra weapon damage die on critical hits          |
| [Powerful Build](../../../../content/skills/racial/index.md)                              | Physical/Strength               | +25% carry capacity, enhanced strength checks     |
| [Battle Fury](../../../../content/skills/index.md)                                        | Combat, Tribal                  | Temporary damage boost when wounded               |
| [Intimidating Presence](../../../../content/skills/common/intimidating-presence/index.md) | Social, Physical/Strength       | +25% intimidation effectiveness                   |
| [Pain Tolerance](../../../../content/skills/racial/index.md)                              | Physical/Endurance              | Reduced pain penalties, fight longer when wounded |

**[Relentless Endurance](../../../../content/skills/passive/relentless-endurance/index.md)**: Orcs refuse to fall. Once per long rest, when reduced to 0 HP, an orc instead survives with 1 HP. This legendary toughness makes orcs terrifying opponents - you can't assume they're down until they're truly dead.

**[Savage Attacks](../../../../content/skills/passive/savage-attacks/index.md)**: When orcs land critical hits with melee weapons, they roll an additional weapon damage die. This makes their critical strikes devastatingly brutal - a greatsword that normally crits for 4d6 becomes 6d6 in orcish hands.

**[Powerful Build](../../../../content/skills/racial/index.md)**: Orcs are simply stronger than most races - able to carry more, hit harder, and overpower opponents through brute force. Their enhanced strength gives significant advantage in physical contests and allows them to wield larger weapons effectively.

**[Battle Fury](../../../../content/skills/index.md)**: Orcs fight harder when injured. As their HP drops, battle fury overrides pain and caution, channeling damage into increased offensive output. This makes wounded orcs more dangerous, not less - finishing an orc quickly matters more than wearing them down.

**[Intimidating Presence](../../../../content/skills/common/intimidating-presence/index.md)**: Orc presence naturally intimidates others. Their size, tusks, scars, and aggressive posture make intimidation attempts highly effective. Even peaceful orcs project threat simply by existing.

**[Pain Tolerance](../../../../content/skills/racial/index.md)**: Orcs shrug off injuries that would incapacitate others. Reduced penalties from wounds, status effects, and environmental hazards allow orcs to keep fighting effectively longer than other races.

**Note on Reputation:** Centuries of raiding and warfare left orcs with terrible reputation in settled lands. [Faction](../../../../../systems/social/factions-reputation/index.md) standings start actively hostile in most [settlements](../../../../../systems/world/settlements/index.md), requiring exceptional effort and concrete demonstrations of trustworthiness to overcome.

**Shamanic Heritage:** Orcs have full access to [shamanic magic](../../../../../systems/character/index.md) through tribal spirit pools. Orc shamanism emphasizes war spirits, ancestor warriors, and battle blessings - practical magic for warrior culture.

## Cultural Notes

### The Honor Code

Orc honor rests on three pillars: face worthy opponents, show strength without cruelty, and uphold tribal bonds. These create rigid behavioral guidelines that orcs follow despite consequences.

"Worthy opponents" means fighting those who can fight back. Attacking the defenseless brings shame. Striking during parley violates honor. Killing prisoners who surrendered dishonors both victor and victim. These rules don't prevent violence - they channel it toward "honorable" targets.

"Strength without cruelty" seems contradictory given orc brutality, but orcs distinguish necessary violence from pointless sadism. Killing in battle earns respect. Torture for entertainment earns contempt. Quick deaths are merciful. Prolonged suffering is wasteful and dishonorable.

"Uphold tribal bonds" means absolute loyalty to tribe. An orc might betray an ally, violate a deal, or abandon a cause - but never their tribe. Orcs who break tribal bonds become outcasts, wandering alone until death or redemption.

### Trial by Combat

Orcs settle disputes through ritual combat - not to death usually, but to submission or first blood. This applies to everything from leadership challenges to property disputes to honor violations. The logic is simple: strength proves worth, and combat reveals strength.

This creates meritocratic but violent culture. Weak leaders get challenged and replaced. Bullies face consequences when victims challenge them. Justice happens through force, which seems barbaric to settled folk but works for orcs - mostly.

### War as Purpose

Orcs need conflict like other races need food. Without external enemies, tribes turn on each other. Without battles to win, warriors grow restless and dangerous. Orc society requires regular warfare to function properly - channeling aggression outward prevents internal collapse.

This dependency on conflict makes peace negotiations with orcs nearly impossible. Even well-meaning orc chiefs can't maintain peace indefinitely - their own warriors demand battle, threatening mutiny if denied. Settlements view this as proof orcs are irredeemable. Orcs view it as simple truth - warriors need wars.

### Battle Glory

Orc culture glorifies combat achievement above all else. The greatest orcs are those with most impressive battle victories, regardless of other qualities. A brilliant farmer or skilled crafter earns less respect than a mediocre warrior with one heroic kill.

This creates problems. Orcs who could contribute through non-martial skills feel pressure to become warriors instead. Tribes undervalue essential support roles. And the constant focus on violence prevents cultural development in other directions.

Young orcs feel this pressure intensely - prove yourself in battle or accept low status for life. Many die trying to earn glory they're not suited for. Some rebel, leaving tribes to seek other paths, but doing so means abandoning everything they've known.

### Shamanic Guidance

Orc shamans walk a difficult line - preserving traditions while adapting to changing world. They remember when orc tribes controlled vast territories, when settlements feared orc strength, when being orc meant automatic respect. Now they guide tribes through diminished circumstances, maintaining pride while acknowledging reality.

The wisest shamans recognize that endless warfare leads to extinction. They counsel restraint, selective engagement, and building strength through means besides constant raiding. Conservative shamans insist on traditional ways, even as those ways lead tribes to ruin. The tension between these approaches defines modern orc spiritual life.

### Integration Struggles

Orcs trying to integrate with settled society face immense challenges. Their size intimidates. Their reputation precedes them. Their cultural emphasis on strength and honor translates poorly to societies built on commerce and law. And their need for conflict has no constructive outlet in peaceful settings.

The few orcs who succeed typically find military roles - city guards, mercenary companies, gladiator pits. These channel orc martial talents productively while keeping them separated from general population. It's not true integration but it's survival, and for many orcs that's enough.

Some orcs adapt further, learning trades, starting businesses, even raising families in settled communities. These individuals prove orcs can change - but they remain exceptions, viewed with suspicion by both settlements and their own people.

### The Cycle of Violence

Orc-settlement relations trap both sides in vicious cycles. Settlements fear orcs due to past raids, maintaining hostile policies. Hostile policies prevent peaceful trade, forcing orcs to raid for necessities. Raiding reinforces fear and hatred. Young orcs grow up hearing they're monsters, internalize the label, and become the monsters they're expected to be.

Breaking this cycle requires mutual trust neither side possesses. Settlements demand orcs prove peaceful intent through years of perfect behavior. Orcs demand settlements treat them with basic respect before changing behaviors. Neither will move first, so the cycle perpetuates, generation after generation.

### Future Questions

What becomes of warrior cultures in ages of peace? What happens to orcs if warfare becomes obsolete? These questions haunt progressive orc thinkers - and terrify conservative ones. If orcs aren't warriors, what are they? If strength doesn't determine worth, how is worth determined?

Some tribes experiment with new identities - honor won through craftsmanship, strength shown through building rather than destroying. Most cling to traditional ways, even as those ways lead nowhere. The tension between preservation and adaptation will determine whether orcs survive as distinct culture or fade into history.
