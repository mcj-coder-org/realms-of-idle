# Gnolls

## Lore

### Origin

Gnolls walk the line between civilization and wilderness with practiced ease. Neither fully settled nor truly savage, they've carved out a niche as the realm's most reliable tribal traders and guides. Their hyena-like features - powerful jaws, spotted fur, hunched posture - initially unsettle [settlement](../../../systems/world/settlements.md) dwellers, but those who do business with gnoll tribes quickly learn to value their straightforward honesty.

Gnoll origin stories vary by tribe, but most trace their lineage to the great plains where prey animals still migrate in vast herds. They claim they were shaped by the hunt itself - given endurance to run down prey, strength to bring it down, and pack instincts to coordinate the kill. Whether literal truth or cultural metaphor, gnolls embody these traits perfectly.

[Shamanic magic](../../../systems/character/index.md) runs strong in gnoll bloodlines. Every tribe maintains at least one [shaman](../../../classes/magic/index.md) who tends the tribal spirit pool, performs rituals, and guides the pack. These shamans don't rule - gnoll leadership belongs to the strongest and wisest together - but their spiritual counsel carries weight. A tribe that ignores its shaman's warnings usually regrets it.

Gnoll tribes migrate with the seasons, following game herds and trading routes. They don't build permanent structures beyond seasonal camps and sacred sites. This nomadic lifestyle keeps them from accumulating the material wealth [settlements](../../../systems/world/settlements.md) prize, but gnolls measure riches differently - in strong pack bonds, successful hunts, and honorable dealings that ensure future trade.

### In the World

Gnoll tribes occupy the spaces between [settlements](../../../systems/world/settlements.md) - the grasslands, savannas, and open forests where agriculture doesn't reach but game remains plentiful. They're territorial but reasonable, marking ranges and defending them from interlopers while negotiating peacefully with neighbors who respect boundaries. Most [settlements](../../../systems/world/settlements.md) with nearby gnoll tribes establish formal agreements: the tribe gets hunting rights, the settlement gets first refusal on furs and meat.

A gnoll's word is their honor, and honor matters intensely. Break a deal with a gnoll and you've made an enemy for life - not just of that individual but of their entire pack. Honor it, even when inconvenient, and you've earned trust that spans generations. This reputation for reliability makes gnolls valuable trading partners despite their fearsome appearance.

Other races have mixed feelings about gnolls. [Humans](../../enlightened/humans/) appreciate their honesty while finding their directness sometimes uncomfortable - gnolls don't soften bad news or hide their opinions. [Dwarves](../../enlightened/dwarves/) respect gnoll work ethic and straightforward dealings. [Elves](../../enlightened/elves/) maintain cordial but distant relations, viewing gnolls as noble savages who could be civilized but choose not to be. [Goblins](../goblins/) and gnolls have complicated relationships - sometimes trading partners, sometimes rivals for territory.

Gnoll packs range from a dozen to fifty individuals, organized around extended family units. Leadership passes to those who prove themselves through strength, wisdom, and successful leadership - not through birth. A chief's offspring have advantages from their upbringing, but they must still earn respect. Unsuccessful leaders face challenges from ambitious pack members, with disputes settled through ritual combat or hunting contests.

The greatest challenge for gnolls is maintaining their way of life as [settlements](../../../systems/world/settlements.md) expand. Hunting grounds shrink as farmland spreads. Traditional migration routes get blocked by roads and borders. Some tribes adapt, integrating more with settled communities. Others retreat to marginal lands. A few resist, leading to conflict that gnolls usually lose - arrows can't compete with organized military forces and [magic](../../../systems/character/magic-system.md).

### Racial Skills

**Skill Pool Tags:** `Combat`, `Nature/Animals`, `Physical/Strength`, `Gathering/Hunting`, `Tribal`

Gnolls receive **3 random skills** from their racial skill pool at character creation, with additional skills available at racial milestone levels (10, 25, 50). Skills must match at least one of the pool tags above.

**Example Racial Skills:**

| Skill                                                           | Tags                                   | Effect                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| [Pack Tactics](../../../content/skills/passive/pack-tactics.md) | Combat/Tactics, Tribal, Nature/Animals | +15% accuracy with nearby allies                 |
| [Scent Tracking](../../../content/skills/racial/index.md)       | Nature/Animals, Gathering/Hunting      | Track by smell, detect hidden creatures          |
| [Endurance Hunter](../../../content/skills/index.md)            | Physical/Endurance, Gathering/Hunting  | -25% stamina drain while traveling               |
| [Savage Bite](../../../content/skills/racial/index.md)          | Combat/Melee, Physical/Strength        | Natural bite weapon, always available            |
| [Hyena Heritage](../../../content/skills/index.md)              | Nature/Animals, Tribal                 | Intimidating presence, pack communication        |
| [Rampage](../../../content/skills/racial/index.md)              | Combat, Tribal                         | Bonus action attack after reducing enemy to 0 HP |

**[Pack Tactics](../../../content/skills/passive/pack-tactics.md)**: Gnolls instinctively coordinate when fighting alongside allies. When a gnoll has an ally within 5 feet of a target, they gain +15% accuracy on attacks. This bonus applies when working with any allies, not just other gnolls, reflecting gnoll adaptability to any pack structure.

**[Scent Tracking](../../../content/skills/racial/index.md)**: Gnolls possess extraordinary olfactory senses. They can follow trails days old by scent alone, detect hidden creatures by smell, and identify individuals by their unique scent signature. Rain and water reduce but don't eliminate this ability.

**[Endurance Hunter](../../../content/skills/index.md)**: Gnolls evolved to run down prey over long distances. They can jog for hours without tiring, making them exceptional scouts and messengers. [Stamina](../../../systems/character/index.md) drains 25% slower while traveling, allowing longer journeys without rest.

**[Savage Bite](../../../content/skills/racial/index.md)**: Powerful jaws and sharp teeth provide gnolls with natural weapons (1d6 piercing damage). Even unarmed, a gnoll can deliver a devastating bite attack. This doesn't replace proper weapons but ensures gnolls are never truly defenseless.

**[Hyena Heritage](../../../content/skills/index.md)**: Gnolls possess distinctive vocalizations - whooping calls, barking laughs, and howls - that serve multiple functions. Natural intimidation (+10%), pack communication over distances, and psychological warfare in [combat](../../../systems/combat/index.md).

**[Rampage](../../../content/skills/racial/index.md)**: When a gnoll reduces an enemy to 0 HP with a melee attack, they can immediately make a bonus action attack against another enemy within reach. This reflects gnoll ferocity and pack hunting instincts.

**Shamanic Heritage:** Gnolls have full access to [shamanic magic](../../../systems/character/index.md) through their tribal spirit pools. They can learn [shamanic crafting](../../../systems/crafting/index.md), cast [tribal spells](../../../systems/character/index.md), and contribute to their pack's spiritual strength.

### Regional Variants

| Variant        | Region       | Shamanic Focus   | Special Traits           |
| -------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Savanna Gnoll  | Grasslands   | Hunt spirits     | +10% movement speed      |
| Forest Gnoll   | Woodlands    | Nature spirits   | +15% stealth in forest   |
| Desert Gnoll   | Arid regions | Ancestor spirits | +20% heat resistance     |
| Mountain Gnoll | High country | Wind spirits     | +15% altitude adaptation |

**Savanna Gnolls** represent the classic gnoll culture - following great herds across open plains, trading with multiple [settlements](../../../systems/world/settlements.md), and maintaining large, prosperous tribes.

**Forest Gnolls** adapted to life in woodlands, becoming more stealthy and less nomadic. They maintain longer-term camps and integrate more with forest [settlements](../../../systems/world/settlements.md), often serving as guides and rangers.

**Desert Gnolls** inhabit arid lands where survival demands careful water management and extreme heat tolerance. They're leaner, tougher, and more isolated than their cousins, with strong ancestor veneration traditions.

**Mountain Gnolls** dwell in high country, hunting mountain goats and trading with [dwarven](../enlightened/dwarves.md) holds. They're the most settled of gnoll variants, maintaining semi-permanent camps near trade routes.

## Cultural Notes

### Pack Structure

The pack is everything to gnolls. Individual identity flows from pack membership - a gnoll without a pack is truly lost, often falling into depression or desperate attempts to join another tribe. Pack bonds run deeper than blood; adopted members who prove their loyalty become as valued as birth pack mates.

Pack hierarchy isn't rigid but it's clear. The chief leads, elders advise, warriors protect, hunters provide, and shamans guide spiritually. Everyone knows their role and contributes. Lazy gnolls face social pressure from all sides - if you don't pull your weight, you're letting down your family.

### The Hunt

Hunting isn't just food acquisition for gnolls - it's spiritual practice, social bonding, and cultural identity rolled into one. Young gnolls prove themselves through their first major hunt. Warriors maintain skills hunting dangerous prey. Elders pass on hunting wisdom to next generations. The pre-hunt ritual, the coordinated chase, the final take-down, the thanks offered to prey spirits - these form the rhythm of gnoll life.

A successful hunt brings the pack together around shared meat, shared stories, and shared satisfaction. An unsuccessful hunt teaches lessons about nature, patience, and working together. Either way, the hunt strengthens pack bonds.

### Direct Honesty

Gnolls don't do subtle social manipulation. They say what they mean, bluntly and clearly. This can shock other races who've learned to soften criticism and imply rather than state. "Your offer is inadequate" means exactly that, not "I'm opening negotiations" or "I'm playing hard to get." When a gnoll says "This seems fair," you can trust they mean it.

This directness makes gnolls terrible courtiers and diplomats but excellent trading partners. You always know where you stand with a gnoll. They might growl and show teeth when angry, but they won't smile while plotting your downfall.

### Territory and Boundaries

Gnolls mark territory clearly - through scent markers, physical markers, and direct communication with neighbors. These boundaries aren't aggressive claims but practical divisions: this is our hunting ground, that's yours, let's not conflict. Respecting marked territory earns gnoll respect. Violating it earns gnoll anger.

When territories overlap by necessity - shared water sources, seasonal migration routes - gnolls negotiate usage agreements. "We use this water hole in morning, you use afternoon." Simple, clear, enforceable. Most gnoll conflicts stem from neighbors not respecting these agreements.

### Honor Code

A gnoll's honor rests on three pillars: keep your word, provide for your pack, and respect worthy opponents. Break your word and you're worthless - even your pack may cast you out. Fail to provide and you're a burden. Show cowardice or treachery and you're despised.

This honor code makes gnolls reliable but inflexible. They'll honor a bad deal rather than break their word, suffering losses to maintain reputation. They'll share scarce food with pack mates even when hungry themselves. They'll face death rather than flee when retreat would be wiser.

### Shamanic Traditions

Every gnoll tribe maintains connection to spirit ancestors through shamanic practices. The tribal shaman tends this connection, performing rituals, seeking guidance, and maintaining sacred sites. Gnoll shamanism emphasizes the hunt, the pack, and the natural world - practical spirituality for practical people.

Young gnolls showing shamanic talent receive special training, learning to hear spirits, create [war paint](../../../systems/crafting/index.md), craft [totems](../../../systems/crafting/index.md), and guide their pack spiritually. Not every tribe produces shamans each generation, but tribes without shamans feel the loss acutely.

### Integration Challenges

Gnolls integrating with settled communities face identity struggles. Pack bonds weaken without daily hunting and migration. Shamanic connections fade in cities built over generations of human habitation. The directness that serves well in tribal context becomes social liability among settlement dwellers who value tact.

Some gnolls adapt, learning to soften their speech and find new purposes in settled life - guarding caravans, serving as scouts, or working in trades where their strength matters. Others never adjust, visiting cities only for necessary trade before returning gratefully to the pack.

### The Territorial Question

As [settlements](../../../systems/world/settlements.md) expand, gnoll hunting territories shrink. What was once open grassland becomes farmland. Migration routes become roads. This forces difficult choices: adapt and settle, retreat to marginal lands, or resist and fight.

Most gnolls choose adaptation, negotiating new arrangements with settlements. Some tribes become semi-settled, maintaining camps near cities and serving as guides, scouts, and trade intermediaries. A few resist, leading to conflicts that gnolls usually lose - but that memory of resistance, even failed, remains important to gnoll cultural identity.
