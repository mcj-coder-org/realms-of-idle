#### The Goblin Paradox

```
Goblins outcast from settlements
    ↓
Pushed to margins, criminal activity
    ↓
Shared memory makes them excellent:
├── Thieves (perfect coordination)
├── Smugglers (instant communication)
├── Spies (information instantly shared)
└── Ambushers (coordinated attacks)
    ↓
Criminal success reinforces prejudice
    ↓
Cycle continues
```
