# Dagger

## Lore

### Origin

Every adventurer carries a dagger. Every cook keeps one nearby. Every hunter owns a skinning knife. Daggers are tools as much as weapons - cutting rope, cleaning game, opening letters, defending in tight quarters. A sword is useless in a grapple, but a dagger saves lives.

### In the World

Daggers are everywhere. Belt daggers for daily carry. Boot daggers for emergencies. Throwing daggers for surprise attacks. Assassins favor daggers for their concealability. Thieves use them for cutting purses and picking locks. Smiths sell more daggers than any other weapon.

A good dagger balances perfectly. The weight should be near the hilt, allowing quick flicks of the wrist. The point must be sharp enough to pierce leather. The edge should cut cloth without effort.
