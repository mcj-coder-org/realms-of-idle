# Longsword

## Lore

### Origin

The longsword is the sword. Not too long, not too short, not too heavy, not too light. A three-foot blade that can cut, thrust, parry, and kill. Generations of smiths have perfected the design, inch by inch, balancing weight, length, and edge geometry.

### In the World

Longswords are the default weapon for warriors, guards, and adventurers. They're versatile enough for battlefield use, compact enough for street fighting, effective enough for monster hunting. Every smithy has longswords for sale. Every fighter trains with one.

A longsword balances about three inches from the guard. This point of balance makes the blade feel weightless in the hand while the tip moves with devastating speed. The grip is long enough for two hands if needed, the pommel acts as a counterweight, the crossguard protects the hand.
