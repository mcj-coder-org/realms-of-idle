# Wood Handle

## Lore

### Origin

Metal is sharp, but wood provides the grip. An axe head is useless without a handle. A hammer can't be swung without a shaft. Wood handles connect metal to hand, providing leverage, balance, and shock absorption.

### In the World

Handles are carved from seasoned wood - dried until stable, then shaped to fit. Axe handles are curved for leverage. Hammer shafts are straight for driving force. Sword grips are narrow for control. Wood selection matters: ash for flexibility, oak for strength, hickory for shock absorption.

Handles break and must be replaced. Every woodsman carries spare handles for their tools. Every smith can re-haft a weapon. The connection between head and handle is critical - too loose and the tool fails, too tight and the handle splits.
