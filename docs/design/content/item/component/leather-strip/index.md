# Leather Strip

## Lore

### Origin

A sword without a grip cuts the wielder's hand. A hammer without a binding can't be swung safely. Leather strips solve these problems. Cut from larger hides, wrapped around weapon handles, tied through haft holes - leather is the silent partner that makes weapons usable.

### In the World

Every smith keeps a basket of leather strips near the anvil. Every weapon needs leather for the grip. Some strips are thin, for delicate daggers. Others are thick, for heavy war hammers. The best strips come from strong, flexible leather - neither too stiff nor too soft.

Leather strips wear out and must be replaced. Warriors learn to rewrap their own weapons. A poorly wrapped grip means a lost weapon in battle - potentially fatal. The wrapping must be tight, even, and secure.
