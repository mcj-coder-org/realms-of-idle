# Food

## Lore

### Origin

Everyone must eat. Travelers carry rations. Armies feed on the march. Villagers store grain against winter. Food is the most basic consumable, the foundation of survival.

### In the World

Food takes many forms: dried meat, hard bread, fresh fruit, cooked meals. Travelers carry portable food that won't spoil. Settlements have markets selling fresh food daily. Cooking transforms basic ingredients into meals that restore more stamina.
