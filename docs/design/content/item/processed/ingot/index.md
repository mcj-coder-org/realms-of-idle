# Ingot

## Lore

### Origin

An ingot is pure metal, shaped into a convenient form for storage and forging. Before ingots, smiths worked directly from smelting pits - messy, inefficient, dangerous. The ingot changed everything. Metal could be smelted in one location, transported to another, and forged at a third time and place.

### In the World

Ingot piles sit beside every forge, organized by metal type. Smiths grab ingots as needed, heat them in the forge, and hammer them into shape. Standard ingot sizes (one pound, five pounds, ten pounds) make calculations easy. A copper dagger needs two one-pound ingots. An iron sword needs three.

Ingots stack neatly, store indefinitely, and trade easily. Merchants price goods in ingots. "That'll be three copper ingots" means more than "that'll be three copper coins" - the metal has intrinsic value, where coins are only promises.
