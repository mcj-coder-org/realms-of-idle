# Tongs

## Lore

### Origin

Hot metal burns. Trying to hold glowing iron with bare hands means severe injury. Tongs solve this problem. Simple, elegant, essential - tongs grip hot metal safely, allowing smiths to move work from forge to anvil and back.

### In the World

Every smith owns multiple tongs. Different tongs for different work: flat tongs for sheet metal, box tongs for square stock, scrolling tongs for curves. The right tongs make work easier. The wrong tongs drop hot metal on the floor - frustrating, wasteful, dangerous.

Tongs must grip firmly but not mar the metal. Loose jaws mean dropped work. Tight jaws mean tool marks. Good tongs are carefully shaped and adjusted. Smiths personalize their tongs, bending the jaws to suit their hands and their work.
