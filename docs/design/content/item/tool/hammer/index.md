# Hammer

## Lore

### Origin

The blacksmith's hammer is the voice of the forge. CLANG. CLANG. CLANG. Each strike shapes metal, each blow drives out impurities, each impact transforms shapeless ingot into useful tool. The hammer is the blacksmith's primary instrument - more important than tongs, more versatile than the anvil.

### In the World

Blacksmithing hammers come in many shapes. Cross peen for drawing out metal. Ball peen for shaping and riveting. Rounding hammer for forming. A smith owns multiple hammers, switching between them as work progresses.

Hammers are heavy tools. A day of swinging hammers builds forearm strength like nothing else. Smiths develop distinctive calluses, their hands shaped by years of hammer work. The rhythm of hammering is hypnotic - strike, examine, strike again, watching metal flow under force.
