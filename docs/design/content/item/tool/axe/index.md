# Axe

## Lore

### Origin

The axe is humanity's oldest tool, predating civilization itself. Stone axes shaped the first wooden tools. Copper axes cleared the first farmlands. Iron axes built the first ships. The axe shape has remained constant for millennia: sharp bit for cutting, heavy head for momentum, wooden handle for leverage.

### In the World

Lumberjacks and woodsmen live by their axes. Felling axes drop trees. Splitting axes divide logs. Hatchets trim branches. Each axe is shaped for its purpose. A good felling axe has a curved bit for deep cuts. A splitting axe has a wedge shape for forcing wood apart.

Axes require maintenance. The bit must be sharpened daily. The handle must be checked for cracks. A dull axe bounces off wood, dangerous to the user. A loose handle flies off on impact, potentially deadly.
