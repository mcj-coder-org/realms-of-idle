# Knife

## Lore

### Origin

Every hunter carries a knife. Skinning knives, boning knives, caping knives - each designed for specific tasks. The skinning knife has a curved, sharp blade that separates hide from meat without cutting either. A good knife makes the difference between clean leather and ruined hide.

### In the World

Skinning knives are kept razor-sharp. A dull knife tears the hide, reducing its value. Hunters sharpen their knives before every kill, carrying whetstones in their kits. The knife must be strong enough to cut through tough hide but flexible enough to follow contours.

A hunter's knife is a personal tool. Many craft their own or pay smiths for custom blades. The grip must fit the hand perfectly - hours of skinning punish poor ergonomics.
