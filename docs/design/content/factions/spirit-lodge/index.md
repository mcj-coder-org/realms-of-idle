# Spirit Lodge

## Overview

The Spirit Lodge is a pan-tribal organization that brings together shamans from diverse cultures and tribes. While shamans maintain strong ties to their home tribes, the Spirit Lodge provides a forum for inter-tribal cooperation, cultural exchange, and resolution of spiritual conflicts that transcend tribal boundaries.
